## Stage 6 API local M1 — verified source published (2026-10-23)

**LOCAL MILESTONE 1 VERIFIED / SOURCE PUBLISHED; INTEGRATION NOT ACCEPTED.**
Existing isolated worktree reused, clean at recovery HEAD `c84c4b99eb27034e3630ff18cf2c470410dbbea2`;
implementation `337847770a579e1f6689c135805ad07a9b2bab19`, approved ancestor
`6dd3136269ec7f5932c8c4b3689fb065d4db9105`. Source and security evidence were
already implemented/committed; recovery audited rather than duplicated that work.
Ordinary guarded push succeeded and exact remote SHA matched c84c4b9.
[Published factual checkpoint](https://github.com/stokonn/Goldberg/issues/31#issuecomment-6372592793). Issue31 OPEN / Goldberg Development In Progress.
Historical DNS/403 publication failures below remain unchanged audit records,
superseded by this successful authorized CLI publication. No new authentication.

- [x] Read approved design, services, adapter, test venues and current handoffs;
  retain existing separate branch/worktree and preserve other worktrees.
- [x] Execute `python3 spikes/stage6-api-v1-local/verify.py`: PASS;106 adapter/wire
  plus38 T22 and18 planning-verifier results, raw hashes and source-before/after/
  current binding verified. These are inspected prior executions, NOT tests rerun
  by publication recovery; prior345 executions were not repeated.
- [x] Protected services/schema/Android/contracts/security evidence byte-unchanged
  against approved baseline; whitespace and publication-scope/clean-HEAD guards PASS.
- [x] Guarded publisher ordinary push and Issue31 description/comment readbacks PASS;
  prior comments preserved, exactly one source-SHA-marked M1 checkpoint.
- [ ] Public `/v1` compatibility remains UNCONFIRMED; local/provisional only.
- [ ] PostgreSQL receipts/locking/durability proof, full-int8 domain writes,
  latest-detail/refetch, HTTP and client/session integration remain unverified.

Executable LOCAL operations: challenge/exchange/refresh/session/capabilities/logout,
explicit moderation open and approve/reject/request_changes. Native domain/Auth/
Community services are unchanged; the new adapter uses explicit mappings, canonical
wire validation and exact public receipts inside domain transactions. No listener.
G5–G8 LOCAL foundation verified; integration gaps remain OPEN. G1–G4 absent, G10
CLOSED, real-world policy empty/default-deny,6.12 PARTIAL,6.17 NOT FROZEN; no formal
6.13–6.18, Android/network activation, production OAuth/cloud, device, merge or release.
Historical PG preflight was EPERM; recovery launched no PG/container/listener and
executed zero PG/HTTP/Android bodies. No current-host availability inference.

Next smallest milestone: bounded authoritative latest-submission Detail/refetch for
409 recovery and permitted disposable-PG adapter/receipt verification. Full-int8
writes and public-version adoption remain separate gates. Stage7A FINAL ACCEPTED;
X10 NOT FIXED/NOT VERIFIED, deferred to Gould0.12; Stage8 readability/accessibility/
touch-target checks retained. Preserve Stage7B dirty work unchanged.

ordinary push failed DNS (`Could not resolve host: github.com`,exit128). Connected
new-branch lookup returns422 `No commit found`; no new remote SHA verified.
Issue31 description append and checkpoint comment both denied403 `Resource not

## Current — Stage 6 API local Milestone 1 (2026-10-23)

**LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION VERIFIED / PROVISIONAL v1 / INTEGRATION NOT ACCEPTED.**
Owner authorization permits this isolated adapter foundation and focused verification,
superseding planning-only limits for this milestone only. Branch
`feature/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-api-v1-local`, worktree
`/home/stokonn/Projects/Goldberg-Stage6-API`, exact approved baseline
`6dd3136269ec7f5932c8c4b3689fb065d4db9105`; original security branch/evidence preserved.
[Approved-design checkpoint](https://github.com/stokonn/Goldberg/issues/31#issuecomment-6371704250).

Purpose/scope: explicit in-process public request/response adapter around existing local
services for G5–G8. No listener, Android changes, browser/hosted integration or public
version adoption. `/v1` consumer compatibility remains unconfirmed, so local paths
are provisional; never silently select `/v2`.

- [x] Inspect Stage6 worktrees and dirty Stage7B read-only; create separate branch from
  exact baseline. No unrelated worktree reset/cleanup/edit or security branch change.
- [x] Implement strict method/path/body/schemaVersion/unknown-field/duplicate-key
  validation, explicit operation projection, safe error taxonomy, request correlation
  and empty204 logout. No competing-dialect inference.
- [x] Execute challenge/exchange/session/capabilities/refresh/logout through actual
  local services; stored identity/expiry projection, live grants, family revocation,
  approved durations and controlled RSA/JWKS exchange. Account principal is server-derived.
- [x] Execute explicit open and three decisions with independent entity/proposal
  revisions; typed200/201, generic409, exact public receipts stored atomically with
  effects,24h from completion, changed intent422 and live authorization before replay.
- [x] Lossless decimal-string int8 reads; valid unsupported full-int8 writes fail503
  after authentication/authorization; malformed values400; domain safe-increment
  exhaustion409. UTC microseconds preserved, scoped signed cursor codec15m tested.
- [x]106 adapter/wire tests PASS:34 service/scripted-SQL,27 original request-scene
  adapter tests,24 routing/validation/security,21 wire/cursor/composition units.
  Includes all8 protocol scenarios and one controlled RSA/JWKS exchange.38 relevant
  T22 regressions and18 planning-verifier tests PASS separately. Source bound before/
  after run and current verification; raw logs retained, no hidden skipped bodies.
- [ ] Local PostgreSQL preflight EPERM;0 DB bodies. No actual HTTP/Android/browser/
  runtime/hosted acceptance. Prior345 executions/313 tests/205 PG-backed bodies
  unchanged and not rerun; full threat matrix remains6.12 PARTIAL/T22 LOCAL PASS.
- [ ] Public latest-detail/refetch DTO, full-int8 moderation writes, PG receipt proof,
  client single-flight/account isolation/204 handling and real HTTP binding remain open.
- [ ] No G1–G4 implementation, real-world policy approval, cloud/OAuth production,
  networking activation, formal6.13–6.18 implementation or6.17 freeze. All real
  source/field/license/attribution/evidence policies stay empty/default-deny.

G10 CLOSED; G1–G9/G11 integration acceptance BLOCKED. Original service/schema/Android/
contract/evidence files unchanged. New receipt wrapper uses existing storage helpers/
table, no migration. See `stage-6/API-V1-LOCAL-M1.md` and package README for actual
operations, test venues, compatibility findings, limitations and next milestone.

Stage7A is FINAL ACCEPTED; X10 is NOT FIXED/NOT VERIFIED, owner-deferred to Gould0.12
([acceptance](https://github.com/stokonn/Goldberg/issues/31#issuecomment-6371745218)).
This supersedes earlier conditional/X10-open cosmetic release gating in historical
entries below. Stage8 readability/accessibility/touch-target verification remains
required; Stage7B integration acceptance remains separate and blocked.

Next smallest local milestone: bounded authoritative latest-submission Detail/refetch
projection for409 recovery, with permitted disposable-PG verification of adapter/public
receipts. Numeric full-int8 writes stay a separate tested change. Stop at all remaining
production, policy, public-version and deployment gates. Publication instructions and
actual outcomes: docs/ai/STAGE6-API-M1-PUBLICATION.md.

## Owner design approval publication — BLOCKED (2026-10-23)

Qualified O1–O8 design approval is verified and committed locally at
`36519e7808887423a9cc8ed663ae33995aaf5698`. Normal push failed DNS (exit128,
`Could not resolve host: github.com`). Connected branch SHA readback remains
published proposal `fefa6e83c2a7b9c4c12660ff1542ab086356de88`.
Both Issue31 description append and checkpoint comment returned HTTP403
`Resource not accessible by integration`. Fresh readback: description unchanged,
all79 prior comments preserved,zero new approval marker; no new checkpoint URL.

Owner design approval remains valid locally; only publication is pending. Full
attempt/draft: `contracts/admin/v1/decision-proposal/design-approval-2026-10-23/`
`publication-attempt.json`. This receipt changes tracking/metadata only; no source,
policy or approval scope change. Use the guarded publisher with the final exact
clean SHA on a permitted Fedora host; instructions in API-V1-PROPOSAL-PUBLICATION.md.
G10 CLOSED; G1–G9/G11 integration BLOCKED;6.12 PARTIAL/T22 LOCAL PASS;6.17 NOT FROZEN.

## Current — API v1 owner design approval recorded (2026-10-23)

**O1–O8 APPROVED AS QUALIFIED DESIGN; O7 PARTIAL; UNIMPLEMENTED / INACTIVE / NOT FROZEN.**
Owner authority: explicit instruction in this conversation; durable record
`stage-6/API-V1-OWNER-DECISIONS-2026-10-23.md` and machine-readable
`contracts/admin/v1/decision-proposal/design-approval-2026-10-23/approval.json`.
Published proposal baseline `fefa6e83c2a7b9c4c12660ff1542ab086356de88` and
[checkpoint6371392069](https://github.com/stokonn/Goldberg/issues/31#issuecomment-6371392069)
verified through connected GitHub reads. This supersedes earlier unpublished-proposal
and pending O1–O8 summaries below; all previous evidence remains historical.

Purpose/scope: record the owner's exact design decisions, reconcile planning/readiness
and verify synthetic fixtures only. Current lifecycle/TTL/revision/numeric/HTTP/audit/
validation design is approved; actual local backend and Android behavior are unchanged.

- [x] Record O1 explicit mapper/204 logout/no secret-bearing offline queue, O2 exact
  access15m/family7d/challenge5m/skew≤60s and refresh rules, O3 independent revisions/
  explicit open/typed200–201/generic409/refetch/reconfirm/exact24h receipts.
- [x] Record O4 lossless int8 strings/UTC precision/scoped cursors15m/404–405 AS DESIGN;
  O5 server Europe/Prague civil daily boundaries including DST, UTC transport,
  coherent exact snapshot and one approval count; O6 NFC/case-insensitive/
  diacritic-sensitive literal search AS DESIGN; O8 documentation sequence only.
- [x] Record O7 PARTIAL: safety validation/1000 UTF-8-byte reason/current projection
  approved by design. All concrete real-world source/field/license/attribution/
  evidence policy sets remain empty/default-deny; no synthetic promotion/legal clearance.
- [x] Preserve original61 DTO/8 protocol scenes and historical UTC alternative;
  add separate4 Prague civil/DST windows and10 CZ/EN/literal search planning cases.
- [ ] Confirm no previously approved/deployed incompatible v1 consumer before `/v1`;
  otherwise prepare `/v2` for separate owner decision. No confirmation claimed here.
- [ ] Determine final query budgets by later local measurement; separately review
  concrete policies and authorize numeric/HTTP/backend/Android implementation.
- [ ] G1–G9/G11 integration BLOCKED; G10 CLOSED;6.12 PARTIAL/T22 LOCAL PASS;
  6.17 NOT FROZEN. No formal6.13–6.18 implementation or API freeze authorized.

Prior345 executions/313 tests/205 PostgreSQL-backed bodies preserved, not rerun.
No Stage7B edits, devices, live endpoints/auth/network/actions, cloud/OAuth production,
merge, deployment or release. Stage7B acceptance BLOCKED, X10 OPEN, Stage8 pending;
existing security/hosted/runtime/zero-cost/legal gates remain. Separate implementation
and policy authorization gates are the stopping point; no repeated O1–O8 approval needed.
Verification: docs/ai/VERIFICATION.md and the separate dated approval verification log.
Publication: docs/ai/API-V1-PROPOSAL-PUBLICATION.md; guarded publisher now emits the
approval checkpoint, never republishes the superseded pending-design summary.

## API v1 proposal publication — BLOCKED (2026-10-23)

Planning package commit `1f9996fd385189b66a42f6abbc8a9944c3030702` verified locally.
Normal push failed DNS (`Could not resolve host: github.com`,exit128). Connected
Issue31 description update AND checkpoint append each returned HTTP403 `Resource
not accessible by integration`. Readback confirms description unchanged,78 prior
comments preserved,zero new matching checkpoint. No new checkpoint URL exists.
Source and tracking publication remain PENDING; no approval or gate closure implied.

`contracts/admin/v1/decision-proposal/publication-attempt.json` preserves the factual
attempt/draft. This receipt commit changes only publication tracking/metadata;
contract package/source proof is unchanged. On permitted Fedora use the dedicated
publisher with the final exact clean SHA; instructions in API-V1-PROPOSAL-PUBLICATION.md.
Stop at owner O1–O8 decision gate. No PostgreSQL rerun or Stage7B changes.

## Current — API v1 owner decision preparation (2026-10-23)

**PROPOSED / INACTIVE / NOT FROZEN.** Worktree `/tmp/goldberg-stage6-security-local`,
branch `verify/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-12-local`, starts at verified published baseline
`19f5642192148051a7b4eb5bc5efb1090192e3c0` and
[checkpoint 6370511889](https://github.com/stokonn/Goldberg/issues/31#issuecomment-6370511889).
This supersedes older “unpublished baseline” summaries below; their evidence is retained.

Purpose/scope: planning-only G1–G9/G11 contract decision package, exact public DTO/
endpoint proposals, synthetic fixtures and offline verification tooling. No production
endpoint/auth/network/moderation activation; G10 remains CLOSED. Stage7B worktree
unchanged. Existing backend, Android source, SQL and historical corpora/evidence unchanged.

- [x] Separate normative design, verified local behavior, Android legacy expectations
  and unapproved preferred design in `stage-6/API-V1-DECISION-PROPOSAL.md`.
- [x] Prepare G1 snapshot statistics, G2 queue metadata/search, G3 audit filters,
  G4 authorized current values, G5 session-derived identity/lifecycle, G6 explicit
  open + independent revisions/replay/conflict recovery, G7 binding/schemaVersion,
  G8 lossless decimal int8, G9 canonical audit/window, G11 byte/policy validation.
- [x] Prepare 61 authored synthetic DTO cases (37 positive/24 negative), 15 verifier
  regressions; preserve 41 primary cases (30 captures/11 proposals) and 29 comparison
  scenes. Exact offline verification results are in docs/ai/VERIFICATION.md.
- [ ] Owner O1–O8 choices in decision document: public lifecycle/version mapper and
  offline logout amendment; TTLs; explicit revisions/receipts; int8/cursor/version
  compatibility; server timezone/window; search/privacy; actual field/source/license
  policy; separate future implementation authorization. No approval inferred.
- [ ] G1–G9/G11 integration BLOCKED; formal 6.12 PARTIAL; 6.17 NOT FROZEN;
  no 6.13–6.18 implementation or acceptance from this task. Browser/fetch/restore/
  privacy/hosted and Android runtime acceptance remain OPEN. X10 OPEN; Stage8 pending.

Prior 345 successful executions/313 tests counting repeated 32 once/205 PostgreSQL
bodies are historical verified source evidence, **not rerun**. Q1/D5b, C4, C2 §12,
cloud/zero-cost/legal and activation gates remain unchanged. Stop at owner decision gate.
Next agent: read proposed decision package and O1–O8; collect owner decisions before
any implementation. Do not run old publisher for this new package; use the dedicated
guarded `contracts/admin/v1/decision-proposal/publish.py` with exact final SHA.
Publication receipt/fallback: `docs/ai/API-V1-PROPOSAL-PUBLICATION.md`.

## Post-T22 reconciliation publication outcome — VERIFIED locally, update UNPUBLISHED

Reconciliation commit `f7d88aae69bdf2a4b1adb248e1020c9a9b3baa8a` preserves the
published/tested6d0abad baseline and checkpoint6370125421. Normal push failed DNS;
connected read confirms remote still6d0abad. Checkpoint write returned403, with
no new URL; prior77 comments had no matching new marker. No dashboard/history edit.
This documentation receipt changes no tested service/fixture/SQL behavior.

345 host executions/313 tests counting repeated unit once;205 PostgreSQL-backed
bodies;17 additional tool regressions PASS. T22 LOCAL PASS, overall6.12 PARTIAL.
G10 remains closed; G1–G9/G11 integration-blocked. No HTTP/hosted/Android acceptance.
New draft and exact blocker: ISSUE31-POST-T22-V3-UNPUBLISHED.md and
post-t22-publication-blocked.json under results/security-local/.

Updated guarded publisher passed local --verify-only atf7d88aa. On permitted Fedora,
supply exact final clean HEAD to publish normally; it verifies the successful v3
counts/source hashes/exit/cleanup, prior evidence, source ancestry and history,
then appends one factual checkpoint after exact remote readback. No repeat of the
successful PostgreSQL suite, force push, guard bypass, emulator, Stage7B changes,
cloud operation, merge/release or6.13–6.18 work. Next: host publication, remaining
local acceptance and explicitly authorized G1–G9/G11 decisions/integration.

## Stage6.12 — post-T22 Fedora version3 VERIFIED; T22 LOCAL PASS, overall PARTIAL

Published/tested base `6d0abad3decf0b724c0e00f1b4e270bf8d244fba` independently read
back on the existing security branch; Issue31 checkpoint6370125421 preserved.
Purpose: reconcile the new actual post-patch PostgreSQL execution and T22 criteria,
not change service behavior or activate public/client integration.

- [x] Exact outer run-x0nDSTXd:27 focused +32 unit +38 T22 +11 contract =108 PASS.
- [x] Matching nested run-TEmZzZQg PG17.11:50 Auth +87 handler +34 schema +34
  integration +32 unit =237 PASS. **345 successful executions;313 tests counting
  repeated32 unit suite once;205 PostgreSQL-backed bodies.** Zero failures/skips/
  cancellations across nine TAPs; model/fixture tests remain distinctly labeled.
- [x] Explicit nested exit0, empty summaryErrors, successful outer flags, exact
  nested stdout linkage; all five checks PASS in both runners. All82 at-run source
  hashes matched before reconciliation edits and immutable31 raw artifacts hashed.
- [x] Removal output names goldberg-public-admin-abuse-3645015; container ID/version
  retained. No new live inventory pass is claimed. All previous runs/FAIL findings
  and pre-patch296/264 baseline preserved without deletion or relabeling.
- [x] T22 LOCAL PASS: actual handler/admin assertions require403 on absent audit edit;
  live self-grant/revocation/escalation and physical SQL immutable-history guards
  executed.38 routing/service models separately verify approved400/401/403 cases.
  No HTTP listener/hosted/Android assertion inferred from local execution.
- [x] Current matrix14 local PASS/6 PARTIAL/2 NOT TESTED. Browser, SSRF fetching,
  restore/RPO, network privacy, Android runtime and hosted portions remain OPEN.
- [x] Stage7B readiness reconciled: G10 remains closed by pinned Android boundary;
  G1–G9/G11 remain BLOCKED for real integration. Corpus captures/proposals retain
  original qualifications and source identities; no public API freeze or activation.
- [x] Evidence verifier/reporting regression tests executed separately; raw results
  in results/security-local/post-t22-tools/. No service/SQL/Android code changes.
- [ ] Normal source push/exact remote readback and one new factual Issue31 checkpoint
  for this reconciliation; record actual publication separately.

Current branch `verify/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-12-local`; current commit follows the
verified6d0abad ancestor. Exact source binding is to6d0abad, with only specifically
identified evidence/index/publication/documentation metadata changed afterward.
Reports: LOCAL-SECURITY-MATRIX.md, T22-INVESTIGATION.md, STAGE7B-CONTRACT-READINESS.md,
post-t22-independent-verification.json. Next: publish verified evidence normally,
then resolve G1–G9/G11 decisions and remaining acceptance under proper authorization.
Formal6.12 PARTIAL; no6.13–6.18, hosted/OAuth/real data/paid, emulator/phone, Stage7B
writes, merge/tag/release or6.17 acceptance. Successful v3 PG run need not be repeated.

## T22/Stage7B update publication outcome — LOCAL ONLY (base publication intact)

Verified code/fixture update `262a76ed08c7910e9a4ad86018188589efc58c37` is committed
on the isolated security branch. Normal non-force push failed DNS resolution;
connected read confirms remote still `e7dc7ea871f61965600ba31076e8d28dc01822fe`.
That base and Issue31 checkpoint6369071469 remain PUBLISHED. This new update's
checkpoint write returned403; no new checkpoint URL or remote success claimed.
The prior76 comments had no matching new marker; no dashboard/history edit.

Raw blocker and draft: `results/security-local/t22-handoff-publication-blocked.json`
and `ISSUE31-T22-HANDOFF-UNPUBLISHED.md`. Updated guarded publisher passed local
read-only verification at262a76e; this following documentation receipt changes no
service/fixture/test behavior. On a permitted Fedora host, run the publisher with
exact final clean HEAD, then the updated version3 PostgreSQL runner. It checks
source/corpus/evidence/approval/counts, normal push ancestry and exact remote SHA,
appends one factual checkpoint and retains history. No repeated network attempts here.

Final119 local tests/five checks PASS; updated PostgreSQL0 bodies dueEPERM. T22
PARTIAL after explicit owner-approved local correction; G10 closed, G1–G9/G11
blocked for real integration. No HTTP freeze, Stage7B edit, emulator, hosted changes,
merge/release or6.13–6.18. Exact next action: publish current scope from permitted
host and obtain current real PostgreSQL regression evidence plus shared decisions.

## Stage6.12 — approved T22 correction and Stage7B contract coordination (PARTIAL)

Published base `e7dc7ea871f61965600ba31076e8d28dc01822fe` and Issue31 checkpoint
6369071469 independently read back; older UNPUBLISHED statements below are historical.
Continue on `verify/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-12-local`, isolated from Stage7B.
Purpose/scope: trace and correct the approved local T22 routing classification,
add focused negative regressions, and prepare exact G1–G11 shared fixture handoff.
No formal6.13–6.18 work or6.17 API freeze.

- [x] Reproduce old400 before authentication/dispatch versus Auth adapter403.
- [x] Explicit owner approval recorded: malformed/non-string/empty operation400;
  well-formed unregistered audit/bootstrap operation403 with no dispatch; registered
  missing/invalid session401; live capability/self-grant403. Applied exact local
  patch and corresponding regression expectations; no new privileged endpoint.
- [x] Final local119 PASS:38 T22 +11 shared-contract +27 security +32 unit Node tests,
  plus11 Python reporting regressions. Zero failures/skips/cancellations in final
  runs. All five repository checks PASS; raw intermediate harness failures retained.
- [x] T22 tests use real services with scripted SQL, not actual PostgreSQL. No role/
  audit mutation attempted in denied cases; expired-key housekeeping rolls back.
  Non-string operation coercion is rejected before handler selection.
- [x] Matrix13 local PASS/7 PARTIAL/2 NOT TESTED; original T22 FAIL remains historical.
  T22 now PARTIAL after explicit owner decision and local fix, not full acceptance.
- [x] Read actual Stage7B source/checklist/acceptance/proposals read-only; hash all
  inspected bytes, including uncommitted work. No Stage7B file/index/build changed.
- [x] Shared Admin v1 preparation:30 actual in-process/scripted-storage captures,
  11 inactive proposals,29 byte-preserved authored Stage7B comparison cases. Exact
  source/corpus hashes; all synthetic, no HTTP binding or PostgreSQL claim.
- [x] G1–G11 ledger records normative/backend/Android/mismatch/fixtures/resolution/
  approval/status. G10 remains CLOSED on Android by static compatibility; G1–G9
  andG11 remain blocked for real integration. No dialect or revision mapping guessed.
- [ ] Current updated PostgreSQL assertions: agent socketEPERM,0 database bodies;
  run version3 local runner on permitted host. Prior owner296 executions/264 tests
  are pre-patch baseline only; original raw manifests remain immutable/Git-verifiable.
- [ ] Hosted/browser/fetch/restore/network-privacy/Android-runtime gates remain OPEN.
- [ ] Commit/push/readback and one non-duplicate Issue31 checkpoint for this update.

Reports: `stage-6/T22-INVESTIGATION.md`, `stage-6/STAGE7B-CONTRACT-READINESS.md`,
`contracts/admin/v1/readiness.json`. Raw final evidence and owner decision:
`stage-6/results/security-local/t22-investigation/`. Production networking and
privileged Android actions remain disabled. Formal6.12 PARTIAL,6.17 not accepted;
no hosted/OAuth/real data/paid/merge/tag/release/emulator/phone/Stage7B writes.
Exact next: publish reviewed scope, execute updated PG17.11 regressions on permitted
host, and obtain G1–G9/G11 implementation/DTO/session/validation decisions before
one approved Android adapter or any live integration.

## Stage 6.12 publication outcome — host tests VERIFIED, source/checkpoint UNPUBLISHED

Fresh Fedora PostgreSQL verification is confirmed:296 executions/264 tests counting
repeated unit suite once;10 separate reporting regressions PASS. This is independent
of publication status. Source update `a21dbafb1180563b88ed36909a801da179b5bf55` preserves
owner-testedfaf9ba3; this following receipt also excludes Python bytecode caches
from the version2 runner source snapshot. Full version2 PostgreSQL run unexecuted.

Normal publication failed: guarded remote lookup and direct non-force push could
not resolve github.com; connector comment returned403; directgh API could not connect.
Issue31 readback:75 comments, all previously read bodies preserved, zero new matching
checkpoint. Exact branch read returned404; no remote SHA or checkpoint URL claimed.
**Source and checkpoint remain UNPUBLISHED.** Existing backend/Android publications
remain valid. New draft `results/security-local/ISSUE31-HOST-VERIFIED-UNPUBLISHED.md`
and raw blocker record `fresh-publication-blocked.json` are retained.

Updated `spikes/stage6-security-local/publish-host.py` passed local read-only guards
at the verified source commit. On a permitted host, supply the exact current clean
HEAD with `--expected-head` (first `--verify-only`, then publish normally). It checks
fresh successful counts/hashes and preserves all prior Issue comments/description;
no repeated PostgreSQL/build run is needed merely to publish these verified facts.
T22 remains FAIL and formal6.12 PARTIAL; remaining local/hosted gates OPEN. Android
runtime deferred, no Stage7B/emulator/hosted/merge/release or6.13–6.18 work.

## Stage 6.12 — fresh owner PostgreSQL evidence confirmed (PARTIAL)

Owner executed the existing version1 security runner on Fedora at exact source
`faf9ba3ec24e7098289c80d6e119519ccc21b95e`. Agent independently inspected both runs:
`stage-6/results/security-local/run-vQd6iGn5/` and
`spikes/stage6-public-admin-abuse/results/run-qx9TUTDk/`.
This supersedes prior statements that fresh PostgreSQL execution is blocked;
all older checkpoints and raw failures remain historical evidence.

- [x] Wrapper:27 focused +32 unit PASS; PostgreSQL17.11:50 Auth +87 handler +34
  schema +34 integration +32 unit PASS. **296 successful executions;264 tests
  counting the repeated32 unit suite once. Zero failures/skips/cancellations.**
- [x] All five repository checks PASS in both runners; wrapper flags false for
  checksOrTestsFailed/postgresBlocked, true for sourceUnchanged. At-run62 source
  hashes all matched before tool edits; immutable55 raw-artifact hashes recorded.
- [x] Exact wrapper stdout equals nested TAP/check concatenation; container removal
  log retained. Successful exit uses owner report/v1 result/control flow; no numeric
  exit sidecar was captured. Live agent Podman inventory is denied by read-only
  runtime configuration; do not claim an additional live-container check passed.
- [x] Preserve run-csaqQFXV/run-cTS0AuDe dependency-startup failures, missing TAP
  summaries and all earlier successful/blocked runs. No destructive cleanup.
- [x] Fix only local verification tooling: version2 writes structured failure JSON
  for missing/duplicate/truncated/inconsistent TAP, retains raw logs, fails closed
  on false-green summaries and source changes; records future nested exit status.
  **10 Python reporting regressions PASS**, separate from296 host executions.
- [x] Matrix uses fresh exact names/logs:168 references; **13 local PASS,6 PARTIAL,
  2 NOT TESTED,1 FAIL**. T22 remains FAIL (observed400 vs required403), with no
  mutation dispatch or demonstrated privilege bypass. No API/SQL/Android changes.
- [x] Publisher now requires the successful actual host counts, immutable artifact
  hashes, tested-source ancestry/identity and current tool/index hashes; it keeps
  PARTIAL wording and duplicate/history guards. Old postgresBlocked=true gate removed.
- [ ] Full version2 PostgreSQL runner execution NOT performed; reporting tests pass.
- [ ] T22 explicit contract/security review; T13 rendering; T14 DNS/redirect/rebinding/
  fetch; T15 HTTP/browser; T19 real restore/RPO; T16/T20 runtime usability; T21 actual
  network privacy; all hosted [I] portions remain OPEN. No automatic gate acceptance.
- [ ] Publication of this correction awaits normal push/exact remote readback and
  one new factual Issue31 checkpoint; prior failed publication remains historical.

Branch `verify/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-12-local`, based on preservedfaf9ba3;
implementation/evidence commit for this update follows that ancestor. Current tool
changes are explicitly separated from the owner-tested version1 runner; at-run
source hashes are checked against current unchanged services or immutablefaf9ba3
for the identified tooling edits. Matrix/index and source hashes remain reviewable.
Read `stage-6/LOCAL-SECURITY-MATRIX.md` and `results/security-local/host-confirmed-faf9ba3.json`.
Exact next: publish the verified evidence/tool fix normally, then resolve T22 and
remaining local acceptance gaps; hosted checks require separate authorization.
Formal6.12 stays UNCHECKED/PARTIAL. Android runtime/emulator recovery deferred;
Stage5/7A/X10/7B untouched. No hosted/OAuth/real-data/paid/merge/tag/release or6.13–6.18.

## Stage 6.12 publication blocker — verified source preserved locally

Audit commit `ebd813509c046c3b6119e2aed953f270ec7d8d92` is LOCAL ONLY on
`verify/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-12-local`. Normal push failed before authentication:
`Could not resolve host: github.com` (exit128). Connected read after failure confirms
exact branch404. Issue31 checkpoint attempt returned403 `Resource not accessible
by integration`; fresh read found73 comments, zero matching new checkpoint marker.
**Source and new Issue checkpoint UNPUBLISHED.** Prior backend9d7150c and Android
2f1524e publication remain verified; unrelated new comment belongs to its author.

Guarded host publisher: `spikes/stage6-security-local/publish-host.py` requires an
explicit reviewed40-character HEAD, correct clean branch/origin/ancestry, matching
baseline/raw evidence/source hashes and PARTIAL findings; normal push only, exact
remote readback, duplicate guard, append-only Issue31 and old description/comments
readback. It neither builds nor deploys. Verify locally with `--verify-only`; actual
network publication remains UNEXECUTED until a permitted host runs it. This receipt
commit follows the verified audit source; use its exact current SHA explicitly.

59 tests/five checks PASS and T22 finding remain as below; no fresh PostgreSQL,
Android/emulator, hosted or later-stage execution. Next: run the guarded publisher
and unchanged disposable PostgreSQL verification on a permitted host, preserve raw
results and continue6.12 acceptance. Overall6.12 PARTIAL, all formal gates unchanged.

## Stage 6.12 — local security verification (2026-10-23; PARTIAL)

Purpose/scope: audit T1–T22 at assertion level and add focused local synthetic
regressions; verification/evidence only. No service, API, SQL or Android behavior
changes. Branch `verify/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-12-local`, based on `bcc7796`;
implementation ancestors: backend `9d7150c5b3f20880fe4d587d9c3bfd65a0f612ce`,
Android `2f1524e4083a98a64d5fa9790f3cdc002d1f8237`, both remote SHAs read back.
This owner authorization supersedes prior instructions deferring *local* 6.12;
6.13–6.18 and cloud/real OAuth/collection/merge/tag/release remain unauthorized.

- [x] Recover instructions, latest Issue #31 checkpoints and isolated worktree.
- [x] Inspect actual assertions and index exact successful test names/files/logs.
- [x] T1–T22 matrix: **13 local PASS, 6 PARTIAL, 2 NOT TESTED, 1 FAIL**. Local PASS
  can use explicit historical unchanged-source execution; no full [I] acceptance.
- [x] Fresh final run: **27 focused +32 existing unit =59 PASS**, zero failures,
  skips or cancellations; five repository checks PASS. Initial27-test log retained
  separately and not added to59. Pre/post runner source hashes unchanged.
- [x] Independently verify historical backend46 source +15 artifact hashes and
  Android15 source hashes. Retain host237 and JVM214 baselines without relabeling
  them as fresh reruns. All historical/failure evidence preserved.
- [x] Record T22 exact-status finding: unknown audit-edit operation returns400,
  threat model expects403. No mutation dispatch or privilege bypass demonstrated.
  Passing diagnostic probe records400; it does NOT pass the403 acceptance gate.
- [ ] Fresh PostgreSQL rerun: loopback socket preflight EPERM, runner exit78;
  **zero database test bodies**, not connection failures counted as executed tests.
- [ ] T13 rendering, T14 DNS/redirect/rebinding/fetch protections, T15 HTTP/browser,
  T19 actual isolated restore/RPO, T16/T20 runtime usability and T21 actual network
  privacy assertions remain OPEN. Hosted [I] requires separate authorization.
- [ ] Reconcile T22 exact status explicitly before accepting it; no silent API or
  contract change in this verification milestone.
- [ ] Normal branch push/exact remote SHA and one append-only Issue31 checkpoint
  pending at this source checkpoint; record actual publication separately.

Matrix: `docs/planning/goldberg-0.11/stage-6/LOCAL-SECURITY-MATRIX.md`.
Raw fresh results/index: `stage-6/results/security-local/`, final `run-x1eRKaqL`.
Reproducible narrow host command: `bash spikes/stage6-security-local/run-local.sh`
on a permitted local host with existing locked dependencies and cached PG17.11
image. It reuses the unchanged disposable backend runner; no hosted connection.
Do not rerun known-blocked PostgreSQL setup in this agent venue. Overall/formal
6.12 remains UNCHECKED/PARTIAL. Android6.10–6.11 runtime/emulator recovery DEFERRED;
packaging already PASS, zero native bodies. Stage5/7A/X10/7B and all user data
untouched. Exact next action: publish the verified audit scope normally, then
obtain a permitted PostgreSQL venue and resolve documented acceptance gaps.

## OWNER STATUS CORRECTION — packaging and source publication confirmed (2026-10-23)

**The implementation is PUBLISHED. JVM/build/lint and instrumentation APK packaging
PASS. Android runtime/UI acceptance remains PENDING.** This entry supersedes all
older statements that packaging or source publication are blocked/unpublished.
Historical checkpoints below are preserved as point-in-time evidence.

Branch implement/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-10-11-local; published implementation HEAD
2f1524e4083a98a64d5fa9790f3cdc002d1f8237. Agent independently read the exact remote
branch HEAD and published Issue #31 checkpoint 6362788710:
https://github.com/stokonn/Goldberg/issues/31#issuecomment-6362788710.
Owner's guarded publisher record confirms preservation of all 70 earlier comments
and the Issue description at publication. Fresh connected read saw 72 comments;
no checkpoint was reposted or edited in this correction, and no build/publication
command was repeated. New documentation correction remains distinct from published
application source; application/test/build files have not changed.

- [x] Prior confirmed Fedora host JVM 214 PASS, 0 failures/errors/skips; debug APK and
 lint BUILD SUCCESSFUL (lint 0 errors / 109 warnings); results remain valid, not rerun.
- [x] Owner executed `./gradlew --no-daemon :app:assembleDebugAndroidTest --stacktrace`:
 BUILD SUCCESSFUL; 51 tasks (30 executed, 21 up-to-date). Task counts are owner-reported;
 original console transcript not supplied. Full instrumentation APK packaging PASS.
- [x] Agent inspected the actual packaged test APK/metadata/manifest/signature:
 com.opus.piano.test targets com.opus.piano using AndroidJUnitRunner, min 26 / target 36,
 trusted signing certificate matches. 991419 bytes; SHA256
 519dcf93d767e9a8fa5fade656f3361fe0f5d332e6e833603d8c66e75c60305e.
 Preserved privately at .gradle/community-host-artifacts/2f1524e/app-debug-androidTest.apk.
 All 15 recorded source hashes match. No APK upload/release.
- [x] Source branch publication and existing checkpoint read back independently.
 No duplicate Issue/checkpoint, dashboard change or repeat publisher execution.
- [x] Narrow non-destructive recovery/verification procedure prepared:
 stage-6/LOCAL-ANDROID-EMULATOR-RECOVERY.md. Preparation only; no VM was launched.
- [ ] Instrumentation execution: 0 Android test bodies; 5 new tests remain pending.
- [ ] Android Keystore/backup runtime, native Room/backup migration/seeded upgrade,
 actual app process death/recreation/cold startup and contributor UI/theme/font/
 CZ/EN screenshots/acceptance remain pending. Overall 6.10–6.11 is NOT fully accepted.

Owner diagnostics (not newly agent-executed VM tests): Fedora 44, Emulator 37.2.12,
KVM available/usable; AVDs stage5-api36 and Medium_Phone_API_37.0; no ADB-connected
device. Repeated SIGSEGV in qemu-system-x86_64-headless, command included
-gpu swiftshader_indirect; last inspected core PID 1321999. **Root cause UNCONFIRMED.**
Official graphics guidance marks this GPU mode deprecated; that is not causal proof.
Procedure retains existing diagnostic evidence and permits at most one explicit,
fresh isolated API36 desktop trial with a documented renderer, existing cached image,
separate AVD registry/data, bounded boot observation and stop-on-crash rules.
No original AVD boot/wipe/config edit, global ADB reset, SDK upgrade, permission/
SELinux change, physical-phone use or repeated crashing launch. If the trial fails,
stop and obtain stack-based diagnosis or a functioning separately selected venue.

New packaging/publication evidence and owner-attribution details:
stage-6/results/android-local/owner-status-correction-20261023/.
Existing application source, Stage 5/7 worktrees and all user/history data untouched.
No code defect/root-cause fix or runtime success is inferred. Formal 6.10/6.11/cloud/
release gates remain unchecked. No 6.12–6.14 start, merge, deployment, hosted change
or release. Exact next action: review the prepared procedure on a permitted host;
no rebuild or republishing of the already successful implementation is needed.

## Host evidence committed; remote publication pending

Host verification evidence commitc4673c25163e8210807d0b85d94cfd4fd30933b9 records
owner-tested1277bed with214/214 JVM tests, lint0 errors/109 warnings, trusted-signed
debug APK and precise coverage/runtime limitations. Application/test source is
unchanged from the tested revision. Normal exact-SHA push ofc4673c2 was attempted
and failed before authentication: github.com could not resolve. Connected GitHub
read confirmed the integration branch absent; Issue31 has68 comments and no new
Android checkpoint. No force-push or dashboard write was attempted.

A narrowly scoped host publisher is prepared at
.gradle/community-publication/publish-host.sh. It checks a clean exact branch/HEAD,
ancestry, unchanged tested source,214 XML results, lint counts, source/artifact
hashes and the preserved APK, then pushes normally, verifies remote SHA and appends
one factual partial checkpoint with readback/history checks. It never deploys or
uploads the APK. The milestone remains runtime-PARTIAL even after source publication.

Exact next compilation (permitted host, no full JVM/lint rerun needed):
`./gradlew --no-daemon :app:assembleDebugAndroidTest --stacktrace`.
Then use a functioning named disposable emulator for5 native tests, existing Room/
backup migration and seeded-upgrade checks, actual process recreation/cold startup
and contributor UI/theme/font/CZ/EN acceptance. Current executor cannot bind sockets;
no active emulator observed, and Stage7B separately reports host qemu SIGSEGV. Native
source-only compilation has passed, but there is no Android test APK or runtime pass.
Do not use a physical phone or start6.12–6.14. All formal gates remain unchanged.

## Android host Gradle verification confirmed — 2026-10-23

**JVM/build/lint VERIFIED; Android runtime acceptance still PENDING.**
Branch implement/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-10-11-local; owner-tested HEAD
1277bedf5056e794a94566e828ffecb4b14338a3 (implementation6e4a627). Before this
recording pass, working tree was clean and all15 recorded source hashes matched.
Owner executed on permitted Fedora host:
`./gradlew --no-daemon :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:lintDebug :app:assembleDebug --stacktrace`
and reported BUILD SUCCESSFUL. Agent inspected the actual generated outputs;
original console transcript was not supplied, so no compiler-warning count is
invented. No application/test source change was needed after this green run.

- [x]31 actual JUnit XML suites: **214 PASS,0 failures/errors/skips**; includes
 40 CommunityRepositoryTest tests and174 existing regressions. These40 are included
 in214, not an additional execution total. Full app/contributor UI Kotlin compiled.
- [x] LintDebug: **0 errors/fatal,109 warnings**. Category counts and raw XML/TXT/HTML
 retained. No warnings located in new data/community or CommunityDraftPanel files;
 SettingsScreen has an existing UseKtx suggestion on an unchanged expression.
- [x] Debug APK assembled, agent signature/badging inspected. ApplicationId
 com.opus.piano, inherited version0.10.1/code11, min26/target36. Trusted signing
 SHA25653eface4978f03dd7f0d7f1eb97ab94eed97055fe04a2a0fab9a7f280141d59e matches.
 APK SHA2568e30d783d223b7fc9b48c780edf6a3f5f24624aa016a77c3312d6f4149a0751d;
 preserved privately under .gradle/community-host-artifacts/1277bed/app-debug.apk.
 APK is not committed, uploaded or released.
- [x] Packaged manifest and data-extraction XML independently inspected: allowBackup
 false/fullBackupContent false; all cloud/device-transfer domains excluded. This is
 structural policy proof, not an executed Android restore/Keystore test.
- [x] Coverage mapped to exact executed XML test names for privacy/DTOs, file drafts,
 independent JVM restart, account isolation, error/retry/conflict/rate limits, cache,
 disabled transport and source-level backup/startup assertions. No network-path
 privacy assertion or Android process-death inference from JVM tests.
- [x] Direct standalone compilation of CommunityLocalInstrumentedTest.kt against
 the host-built app classes, SDK36 and cached AndroidX PASS. **0 Android test bodies
 executed**; no Gradle androidTest APK packaging claim.
- [x] Agent reran five repository checks: all PASS, including host DDL migrations
 1→10..9→10 and portable backup fixtures. No Room/personal/backup source change.
- [ ] Gradle :app:assembleDebugAndroidTest, packaging/install of test APK,5 new
 Android Keystore/tamper/backup-flag/filesystem/disabled-boundary tests.
- [ ] Existing Room/backup native migration and seeded upgrade verification;
 actual Android process death/recreation, cold startup, contributor UI/theme/font/
 CZ/EN screenshots and user-visible draft/error states. No physical phone use.
- [ ] Normal branch push/exact remote-SHA verification and Issue31 checkpoint.

Evidence copied before build outputs can be overwritten:
stage-6/results/android-local/host-confirmed-1277bed/ contains31 JUnit XML files,
raw lint reports, coverage.json, verification.json, source/artifact hashes and
APK/policy/direct-instrumentation-compile checks. Source identity relies on owner's
exact tested-revision report, initially clean tree and matching recorded hashes;
manual host command did not capture a contemporaneous source manifest. No claim
of signed execution attestation. Earlier blocked runs/failure logs remain intact.

Runtime venue: fresh executor loopback-bind probe returns EPERM; no active emulator
observed. Stage7B checkpoint6359455362 separately reports host qemu SIGSEGV. No
repeat crashing launch, AVD wipe, phone use or sandbox bypass. Existing granular
policy forbids host escalation prompts. A functioning permitted emulator venue is
required; shared Stage5/7 emulator state/worktrees must remain preserved.

All formal6.10/6.11/cloud/release gates remain unchecked; overall milestone remains
PARTIAL pending runtime acceptance. No real OAuth/endpoint/production upload,
Supabase/Cloudflare change, main merge, release or6.12–6.14 start. Next action:
compile test APK on permitted host, then execute scoped tests and native migration/
upgrade/UI acceptance on a named disposable emulator; publish this factual partial
checkpoint after normal source push and exact remote readback.

## Concurrent Stage7B checkpoint observed after source commit

Fresh Issue31 read:68 comments, all67 original comment bodies preserved. New
checkpoint6359455362 reports independent Stage7B source49680da/cee9330 published,
host Gradle204 PASS/lint/APK/androidTest compilation, and qemu SIGSEGV preventing
emulator acceptance. These are that checkpoint's reported results, not Android
6.10–6.11 results; they do not turn this branch's blocked Gradle/native checks green.
The earlier source checkpoint's67-comment count was correct when recorded.

No Stage7B code/worktree/Issue content modified or merged. Its independent Admin
session/transport foundation may require shared session/credential reconciliation
when branches are explicitly integrated; no incompatible live auth exists here,
because contributor production transport/enrollment remain disabled. Its requested
stats/queue/audit-search contract additions are outside6.10–6.11 scope and have not
been invented or implemented. Host emulator verification needs a functioning
permitted emulator venue; do not repeatedly launch the documented crashing host
emulator or use the owner's physical phone. Local candidate remains PARTIAL with
40 direct JVM tests passing, full Android acceptance pending, publication unstarted.

## Android partial source saved — publication and acceptance pending

Implementation candidate commit6e4a627eab72c5c2056151c122556d5442417d91 on
implement/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-10-11-local, descendant of verified backend9d7150c.
Direct Kotlin/JUnit40 PASS and five host checks PASS; final captured source run is
stage-6/results/android-local/jvm-ofm366xf. Core/credential Kotlin was compiled;
full Android UI/build/lint and5 runtime tests remain unexecuted. Formal6.10/6.11
are unchecked and this local Android milestone is PARTIAL.

Git shell read failed resolving github.com; connected GitHub confirms the new
branch is absent. No unverified Android candidate was pushed. Issue31 remains at67
comments; no new checkpoint/dashboard edit. Prepared host verification is
scripts/verify-community-android-local.sh; optional EMULATOR_SERIAL must explicitly
name a disposable confirmed emulator. Host publication instructions and an exact
partial checkpoint are saved under ignored .gradle/community-publication/; publish
only after appropriate host verification and a normal exact-SHA remote readback.

The source commit retained raw log trailing blank lines. A scoped .gitattributes
rule disables blank-at-eof checks only for .log artifacts, preserving their raw
bytes; source/document whitespace checks remain enabled. No test failure was hidden.
Host execution approval was automatically rejected because sandbox_approval:false
prevents escalation prompts. No bypass, real network API, deployment, real account,
physical phone, main merge or release action. Next action is permitted-host Android
verification of this source, followed by emulator acceptance; not a new milestone.

## Android 6.10–6.11 partial source checkpoint — 2026-10-23

Branch implement/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-10-11-local; isolated worktree
/tmp/goldberg-stage6-android-local, remote-verified backend base9d7150c.
Implementation commit is the containing scoped source commit. Backend237 PASS and
published Issue31 checkpoint6358952579 verified;67 old comments preserved.
Purpose: local-first Android community repository, contribution DTOs and safe
unavailable/error/retry behavior. Scope: data/community, lazy OpusApplication
composition, small Settings subpage, EN/CZ strings, JVM/native tests and host scripts.

- [x] Typed strict privacy-isolated request DTOs, public overlay/feed DTOs and
  disabled production transport, deterministic synthetic-only fixture transport.
- [x] File-backed local drafts with stable IDs/account namespaces, atomic saves,
  optimistic conflicts, incomplete editing, exact pending request/key persistence,
  explicit reviewed copy for new logical work, no background publishing.
- [x] Distinct400/401/403/404/409/422/429/503/offline/server/storage states, retry
  windows, uncertain outcome/receipt-save/cancellation safety and stale cache labels.
- [x] Candidate AndroidKeyStore AES-GCM credential adapter, no-backup location,
  local credential clearing; Google profile identity remains presentation-only.
- [x] Local draft Settings subpage using existing navigation/theme/components and
 29 localized strings; actual remote-submit control disabled, no fixture success UI.
- [x] Direct Kotlin/JVM **40 PASS,0 failures**; credential class compiles against
  SDK36. Separate JVM process recreates persisted draft store. Five host checks PASS,
 951 EN/CZ resources; host Room1→10..9→10 and backup fixtures PASS.
- [ ] Full Gradle JVM/lint/build/androidTest compilation: blocked before tasks by
  FileLockContentionHandler wildcard-IP failure. Initial raw log retained.
- [ ]5 new Android runtime tests, Room/backup instrumentation, emulator startup/
  process-death/upgrade and actual contributor screenshots. No physical phone used.
- [ ] Push verified partial source/checkpoint, then obtain permitted host execution.

Narrow host run request was AUTOMATICALLY REJECTED: sandbox_approval:false prevents
require_escalated and cannot display an approval prompt. No bypass attempted.
This is PARTIAL Android implementation, not formal6.10/6.11 completion. No actual
network privacy assertion, real service auth, hosted or UI runtime claim. Initial
new unit fixture error31/32 (Integer-vs-Long assertion) fixed; final40 PASS. Original
regression sources unchanged; full app regressions remain unexecuted.

No Room migration: schema10/backup v5/practice/profile/Google identity and backend
source untouched. Stage5/Stage7A/Stage7B branches/worktrees preserved. Backend
baseline predates six later Stage5 fixes; they remain on32cf5d9 for future integration.
No real endpoint or OAuth, upload/deploy/release/tag/main merge/subsequent-stage work.
Source/evidence/limits: stage-6/results/android-local/SUMMARY.md and source manifest.
Next: run scripts/verify-community-android-local.sh on a permitted host; inspect/fix
actual build/test results, then explicitly targeted disposable-emulator checks.
Only after acceptance recommend separate6.12–6.14 verification; do not start it.

## Local 6.7–6.9 implementation VERIFIED — Fedora host evidence, 2026-10-23

Publication is PENDING. Owner explicitly reports executing the existing runner
on Fedora in the permitted host environment. The agent independently read its
retained TAP/log files at spikes/stage6-public-admin-abuse/results/run-8SWyGyB0/;
this is owner-executed host evidence inspected by the agent, not agent-executed
sandbox PostgreSQL tests. Supersedes the earlier PARTIAL/execution-blocked entries
below for local implementation verification only. Historical failures remain intact.

Purpose/scope: reusable public catalogue overlay/change-feed, remaining Admin
operations and abuse protection/independent cleanup in the existing in-process
adapter. Original Auth/session/idempotency/audit/queue/open/decision implementations
are reused; additive local 004 migration; no HTTP listener or deployed API.
Branch implement/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-7-9-local, based on 262847e, preserving
partial source defbf346904c9aa082a4afc8cac625ce8ea8b923 as an ancestor.
Final implementation is the containing verified source commit; publication details
will be recorded separately. Stage5/Stage7A/X10 and unrelated worktrees untouched.

- [x] Inspect host preflight (localTcp available), PostgreSQL17.11, Node22.23.1,
  raw TAP test bodies/results, all five host check logs and own-container cleanup.
- [x] New PostgreSQL integration34 + unit32 + original handlers87 + Auth50 + schema34:
  **237 PASS; 0 failed, skipped, cancelled**. No hookFailed/not-ok records.
- [x] Current service/test bytes match all11 pre-run retention-candidate hashes;
  current runner matches its pre-run hash. Both manifests predate host execution.
  Owner confirms execution from this worktree; mtimes/TAP names agree. Host runner
  did not capture an at-run source manifest: do not claim cryptographic execution
  attestation. Additive final manifest covers46 source/dependency/test/migration/
  runner files;15 retained host artifacts hashed separately.
- [x] Original171 test sources, schema/Auth sources and old migration/history files
  unchanged. Original32-source manifests:30 unchanged; existing adapter and
  publication max-revision allocation are the two intentional extensions.
- [x] Public private-data separation, published projection, quarantine on old
  overlay cursors, publication/supersession/rollback events, numeric feed highwater/
  concurrent polling/equal timestamps/more-than-nine events and int8 max sequences.
- [x] Admin capability/default-deny/reason/exact-conflict checks, self-grant denial,
  role revocation/suspension/reactivation, role replay after revocation, Admin
  same-key replay/mismatch and distinct-key entity races, immutable audit export.
  Quarantine/rollback faults after lock/projection/audit/feed and at deferred commit
  preserve exact snapshots; same-key retry succeeds without rewriting history.
- [x] Daily/pending limits, competing final principal/IP quota slots, keyed coarse
  groups, duplicate replay without recounting, IP/day windows, explicit Retry-After,
  intake kill-switch read-only behavior, quota-store outage/recovery and rollback
  of both counters/business work at faults/idempotency insertion.
- [x] Independent janitor PostgreSQL cleanup with intake disabled; only expired
  coarse hashes removed, principal counters and submission/audit/publication
  evidence preserved. Unit lifecycle covers idle tick, no overlap, stop/drain,
  storage-fault retry and minimal safe diagnostics. Explicit start/stop is a future
  local runtime responsibility, not an installed daemon or hosted schedule.
- [ ] Push verified source normally and verify exact remote branch SHA.
- [ ] Append the factual verified checkpoint to existing Issue31 after remote
  verification; preserve all prior66 comments and unchanged dashboard.

Exact coverage/limitations: spikes/stage6-public-admin-abuse/results/SUMMARY.md,
verified-host-results.json, verified-host-source-sha256.json and
verified-host-artifacts-sha256.json. Source review found no genuine defect requiring
changes after this green host run; verified implementation/tests/runner unchanged.
Local T14/T16/T17/T18/T20/T22 subchecks only, no entire threat row accepted.
T14 remains no-fetch/URL deny-policy; DNS/redirect/rebinding retrieval unexecuted.
No HTTP/browser/hosted RLS/real OAuth/Android/offline/restore-RPO venue tested. Public
output supports reviewed plain-text display metadata and license/count summaries;
real source/field/license compatibility stays unresolved and default-deny. No real
users/credentials/IP diagnostics. Synthetic windows are not legal retention periods.
Number-based legacy writes still reject unsafe JSON integers; public/new Admin
int8 values use exact decimal strings. No production load/SLA claim. Event and
Admin expectedEventSeq fixtures are local extensions; client freeze remains later.

Formal6.1–6.18/6.0f and Q1/D5b/C4/C2 §12 remain unchanged; no hosted/cloud/Supabase/
release/merge/tag/APK action. Local server milestone is ready as the basis for a
separately authorized6.10–6.11 milestone; Android work has NOT started and is NOT
implicitly authorized. Remaining work in this milestone is GitHub publication,
not another general planning/security pass or a repeat of the host-green suites.

## Recovery attempt — permitted host execution unavailable (2026-10-23)

PARTIAL, NOT COMPLETE. No new commit/push; local HEAD remains
`defbf346904c9aa082a4afc8cac625ce8ea8b923` on
`implement/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-7-9-local`.
Preserved all existing staged/unstaged/untracked work, original evidence and 171-test
baseline. Before changes, saved tracked.patch, working-files.tar.gz and per-file
hashes for all 24 modified/untracked files under
`/tmp/goldberg-stage679-recovery-20261023T052407Z`. No existing scheduler/service/test
source or raw result was overwritten; unrelated worktrees untouched.

Minimal fresh diagnostics: IPv4 socket creation EPERM; Unix socket creation allowed
but bind/listen/connect probe fails EPERM; github.com DNS EAI_AGAIN. Seccomp is active
and NoNewPrivs=1; exact filter rule is not inspected/claimed. Rootless Podman fails
before startup on read-only /run/user/1000/libpod. These are execution-environment
failures before application/database test assertions, not proven code defects.

Requested narrowly scoped host execution of the existing disposable-PG17 runner.
Automatic approval review rejected it before execution: granular approval policy
has sandbox_approval:false and disallows require_escalated. No permission prompt
can be presented through this tool. No bypass, alternate host, deployment or hosted
fallback attempted. Host permission therefore could not be obtained in this session.

Improved only the reproduction runner: fail-fast local TCP preflight with machine-
readable diagnostics before any test hooks/container, plus all five host checks.
`bash -n` PASS; restricted preflight correctly exits78 and executes zero DB test
bodies. Fresh direct unit run: 32 PASS,0 failed/skipped/cancelled. Fresh five host
checks: all PASS. Prior single-user PG17.11 smoke evidence retained; not rerun.
Full 34 new integration bodies and 87+50+34 original regression bodies NOT executed
in this recovery. Previous connection-hook failure records retained unchanged.
Uncommitted cleanup scheduler still awaits real PostgreSQL integration; no source
acceptance or complete threat-model claim. Remaining 6.7/6.8/6.9 integration assertions
are exactly those listed in the previous checkpoint; no newly observed code defect.

Live connected GitHub read: implementation branch still absent; Issue31 OPEN with66
comments. Remote URL remains https://github.com/stokonn/Goldberg.git. No push after
unverified tests; no new public checkpoint/body/dashboard edit. Exact pending comment
remains in results/publication-attempts.json as UNPUBLISHED. Previously observed
connector403 and CLI network errors remain publication blockers.

Exact host-side command (same worktree, existing installed pinned dependencies and
cached PG17.11 image; starts/removes only its own synthetic container):
`bash /tmp/goldberg-stage6-public-admin-abuse/spikes/stage6-public-admin-abuse/run-local.sh`
It runs units, all34 new PG tests including janitor, original87/50/34 suites and the
five checks, preserving each attempt in a fresh results/run-* directory. In a
permitted host, inspect actual assertion results and fix defects before committing
and pushing normally; verify exact remote SHA before posting Issue31 checkpoint.

No hosted/Supabase/OAuth/Android/Stage5/Stage7/merge/tag/APK/release action. Formal
6.1–6.18/6.0f gates unchanged. NOT ready for Stage6.10–6.11. Next action requires a
host execution venue permitting local sockets; this session cannot grant it.

## Follow-up — network diagnosis and retention candidate (2026-10-23)

PARTIAL. Local implementation checkpoint remains
`defbf346904c9aa082a4afc8cac625ce8ea8b923` on
`implement/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-7-9-local`; no new commit or successful push.
Live GitHub matching-refs confirms implementation branch absent; commit lookup
returns HTTP422 No commit found; handler base remains 262847e. Exact-SHA ordinary
push retry fails before authentication. Local IPv4 socket creation fails EPERM;
github.com DNS returns EAI_AGAIN. No force-push or existing work overwrite.

Issue #31 comment NOT POSTED: connector403 Resource not accessible by integration;
CLI cannot connect. Fresh independent reads confirm body and all 66 comments
unchanged. Exact pending comment and publication diagnostics are retained in
spikes/stage6-public-admin-abuse/results/publication-attempts.json. No dashboard diff.

Independent retention scheduler/prune follow-up exists in the working tree:
32 unit tests PASS; PostgreSQL17.11 single-user retention smoke PASS. It runs
independently of intake with explicit lifecycle, suppresses overlapping sweeps,
drains on stop and retries storage faults without private diagnostic content.
SQL checks preserve active/principal counters and submission/audit/publication
history. Compose exposes janitor.start()/stop() for the future local runtime;
no daemon, HTTP listener, hosted scheduler or infrastructure was started.
**Follow-up is UNCOMMITTED** because its PostgreSQL transaction wiring is not
verified, respecting the owner's instruction to commit/push only verified work.

Latest new integration attempt: **34 hook failures, 0 test bodies executed**,
connection EPERM. Original 87/50/34 regression attempts remain setup failures, not
passes; prior 171 PASS is historical only. No code failure conclusion can be drawn
from blocked setup. Five host checks rerun PASS; current source hashes preserved
separately in retention-candidate-sha256.json, without overwriting earlier manifests.

Unfinished 6.7: execute public/private, quarantine, supersession/rollback, equal-time,
concurrent pagination/highwater/cursor and BIGINT integration assertions.
Unfinished 6.8: execute capability/revocation/suspension/role wrapper, reason/conflict,
Admin races/idempotency, transaction-boundary faults and audit/history assertions.
Unfinished 6.9: execute PostgreSQL quota/pending/IP last-slot races, clock windows,
idempotency/fault/kill-switch/Retry-After and independent cleanup integration.
All 171 original regression bodies must run successfully in an allowed PG17 venue.
Full HTTP/browser/hosted/Android threat acceptance unexecuted; no full threat row PASS.
Formal gates unchanged; no cloud/Supabase/Stage5/7 modification. Not ready for 6.10–6.11.
Next: restore permitted local PG17 network/container execution, run run-local.sh,
fix any actual assertion failures, then commit verified follow-up and safely publish.

## Local 6.7–6.9 candidate — PARTIAL, 2026-10-23

Purpose/scope: public overlay/feed, remaining Admin operations and PostgreSQL abuse
protection under spikes/stage6-public-admin-abuse; two narrow existing handler
extensions and additive local migration 004. Branch
implement/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-7-9-local; isolated worktree
/tmp/goldberg-stage6-public-admin-abuse; live GitHub-verified base
262847ebcdef18d186ded5b7af4825436a1dc4e3, direct child of c80c03e.
Source checkpoint is its containing implementation commit; publication follows.

- [x] Read canonical instructions, latest Issue #31 body/66 comments/checkpoint,
  verify live remote ancestry and isolate work without changing earlier branches.
- [x] Add candidate public, Admin and quota services; reuse existing core and
  role/suspension functions; preserve original 171 test files and historical evidence.
- [x] Execute 30 unit checks PASS, five repository checks PASS; single-user PG17.11
  migration SQL and scoped history/feed/quota/rollback smoke assertions PASS.
- [ ] Execute 33 new PostgreSQL integration tests and original 171 regressions.
  Actual attempts: 33 + 87/50/34 hook failures, 0 bodies executed (connect EPERM).
  Separate attempts on the unchanged original worktree fail identically.
- [ ] Verify concurrency, Admin transaction boundaries, end-to-end authorization,
  idempotency, quota windows and all integration assertions in a socket venue.
- [ ] Finish independently scheduled coarse-IP expiry cleanup/retention acceptance.
- [ ] Publish source branch and append a verified partial checkpoint to Issue #31.

Podman fails on read-only /run/user/1000/libpod. A disposable PostgreSQL17.11 cluster
initialized from cached local binaries; TCP startup is denied by the sandbox.
Single-user SQL execution succeeds but cannot prove JavaScript service or concurrent
behavior. Full source hashes, commands, failed attempts and exact threat limitations:
spikes/stage6-public-admin-abuse/results/SUMMARY.md. Original 32-source manifest:
30 unchanged; only adapter and publication revision allocation intentionally changed.
No old hash/log overwritten. Local retention currently prunes only during fresh
intake; real source/field/license policy stays unresolved/default-deny. No fetcher.
T14/T16/T17/T18/T20/T22 subchecks only; no whole threat row acceptance.

Formal 6.1–6.18/6.0f unchanged; Q1/D5b/C4/C2 §12 open. No hosted, real-user,
Android/Stage7/Stage5, main merge/tag/APK/release action. Not ready for 6.10–6.11.
Next: obtain an allowed local PostgreSQL17 socket/container venue, execute
run-local.sh and fix/verify actual results, finish retention, then acceptance.
No Issue dashboard diff proposed; description and prior comments remain untouched.

## Local handlers publication verified — 2026-10-23

Branch `spike/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-handlers-local`; implementation
`c80c03eee3f908437dda3fc75e366a9e2f1b995c` pushed and exact remote HEAD verified.
[Issue #31 implementation checkpoint](https://github.com/stokonn/Goldberg/issues/31#issuecomment-6357457691)
appended and independently read back exactly; 66 comments, all 65 full older
records unchanged. Body remains the approved link-only version (SHA-256
cbb0579ef81b7d92052d9878d4d3d306718d9fe2168e01984548a2b54081af81);
labels/milestone/state preserved and Goldberg Development In Progress. No further
body/status edit. This documentation-only follow-up records publication; tested
implementation and 10-source hash manifest remain unchanged.

Local milestone verified and published: 87 new + 50 Auth + 34 schema = 171 PASS,
zero failed/skipped/cancelled; five host checks and original 22 hashes PASS.
Initial four failures and fixes retained. No source change since final execution.
Formal 6.4–6.6 NOT COMPLETE; Q1/D5b, C4, C2 §12 and 6.0f remain unresolved.
Real license/field/source rules remain undecided, validator defaults fail closed.
Cloud/Stage 5/Stage 7/Android unchanged. No merge/release/APK/screenshots/device.
Next recommendation only: separately authorized 6.7–6.9; not started. Resume from
this branch's living LOCAL-HANDLERS-PROTOTYPE checklist/results and checkpoint.

## Local 6.4–6.6 verified implementation — 2026-10-23

Owner-authorized local synthetic prototype; not formal 6.4–6.6 acceptance or 6.0f
waiver. Branch spike/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-handlers-local, isolated worktree
/tmp/goldberg-stage6-handlers; remote Auth base
7993444b86690d95aae03aa23383b80014dec031.
Implementation source commit is the containing commit; publication follows.

Purpose/scope: separate validation/submission/moderation/idempotency/events/audit
export/local adapter modules under spikes/stage6-handlers-local, reviewed narrow
changes_requested contract clarification, and Stage 6 tracking only. No database
change/migration. Original 34 schema + 50 Auth source/hash/history preserved.
Implemented immutable snapshots and audit, private ownership reads, authorized
open/approve/reject/request_changes, absent/existing entity serialization and
atomic feed/projection, exact stored-response replay and principal/request hashing.
Unexpected SQL remains safe 503; stale decisions 409; mismatch 422.

Final executed command: spikes/stage6-handlers-local/run-local.sh — exit 0,
PostgreSQL 17.11: **87 new + 50 Auth + 34 schema = 171 PASS, zero failures/skips/
cancellations**. Five scripts/check_*.py PASS; original 22 source hashes PASS.
Initial 77/81 failure evidence retained: numeric export ordering after seq 9
fixed in a new exporter, old helper untouched; existing-entity fixture revision
corrected. Intermediate 81+84 passed; final expanded 87+84 passed. Disposable
container removed. Exact outputs/source hashes/threat qualifications:
spikes/stage6-handlers-local/results/SUMMARY.md and
docs/planning/goldberg-0.11/stage-6/LOCAL-HANDLERS-PROTOTYPE.md.

Issue #31 approved link-only update PUBLISHED via existing CLI after connector
write returned 403 Resource not accessible by integration. Fresh concurrency
check matched old body SHA dd2829c6…35f2a; independent CLI+connector readback
exact, new body SHA cbb0579ef81b7d92052d9878d4d3d306718d9fe2168e01984548a2b54081af81.
All 65 full comments preserved; metadata/milestone/labels unchanged; Goldberg
Development In Progress, Priority Medium/Version 0.11. Latest URL now points to
6351715021 as expressly approved. Further body changes need approval; append-only
implementation checkpoint pending source publication. No historical comment edits.

Local T6–T14/T17/T18/T21 subchecks only; no full threat-row pass. No HTTP/browser/
CSRF/real-provider/hosted RLS, DNS/redirect fetches, Android/Gradle/APK/UI/device,
quota/kill-switch, full Admin/overlay/restore/RPO work executed. Source/field/license
compatibility policy for real contributions remains incomplete: default validator
denies all; tests inject reviewed authored synthetic CC0 evidence, not a new real
license policy. Unknown licenses/fields fail closed; structured non-text metadata
is unsupported. No fetcher/proxy or public endpoint. Unresolved identities are
preserved and cannot be automatically merged/published. Historical C6 same-key
[201,409] unchanged; actual new handler same-key replay [201,201], one effect.

Q1/D5b unresolved; C4/C2 §12 OPEN; 6.0f/formal 6.1–6.18 unchecked; 6.0d/6.0e
unauthorized; 0 CZK/month, no real collection. Cloud, Stage 5 and Stage 7A/7B
unchanged; no app/practice/backup/signing changes, merge/tag/release. No APK was
built; APK digest/signing/screenshots not applicable.

Next steps: publish verified isolated source/checkpoint; then stop. Recommend
separately authorized **6.7–6.9** (public overlay/feed, remaining Admin operations,
abuse controls). Do not start automatically. Read this checkpoint, latest Issue
#31 comment and source/hash artifacts on resume; preserve all unresolved gates.

## Local Auth milestone publication — 2026-10-22

Source commit 76c1c879b5642236490e1f14b652fdf5e5ebdc7a pushed/remote verified on
spike/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-auth-local. Final 50 new + 34 original tests PASS;
zero failed/skipped/cancelled. Tested source hashes unchanged. Original schema
branch remains 0f966dc; Stage 7A 576f0d2 and all unrelated worktrees/files preserved.

[Issue #31 checkpoint](https://github.com/stokonn/Goldberg/issues/31#issuecomment-6351715021) posted under the owner's explicit instruction;
independent readback exactly matches. All 64 previous full comments preserved,
65 total; labels/milestone/state and Project In Progress unchanged. Proposed body
changes only the Stage 6 Latest checkpoint URL to that comment. Exact diff shown
and approval requested; UNPUBLISHED pending reply. Current body baseline remains
9,592 characters/52 lines, SHA-256
dd2829c6576e9648396505c9cd87e70e3ae8667e4f35a7ac571bb90e59e35f2a.
Re-fetch before any approved write; stop on unrelated edits, preserve other stages.

Local prototype milestone COMPLETE, formal 6.2/6.3 NOT COMPLETE. Q1/D5b/C4/C2 §12/
6.0f remain open; all formal tasks 6.1–6.18 unchecked; cloud/collection approvals
unchanged. No automatic 6.4–6.6 continuation. Next only after new scope instruction:
full bounded typed submissions, authenticated atomic moderation and request-bound
idempotency, with the existing contract discrepancy reviewed before endpoint adoption.
This publication bookkeeping checkpoint is its containing documentation commit.

## Current checkpoint — local Auth/session/AuthZ prototype (2026-10-22)

Owner explicitly authorized isolated LOCAL-ONLY task-design 6.2/6.3 prototype,
not formal acceptance or gate amendment. Branch spike/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-auth-local,
base 0f966dc (actual latest schema remote, newer than observed f54881e), isolated
clone .gradle/stage6-auth-prototype. Original schema branch/evidence and Stage 5/7
worktrees/code preserved. This source checkpoint is its containing commit.

Implemented spikes/stage6-auth-local: strict jose 6.2.13 JWT/JWKS verification,
bounded injected keys/clock, stable issuer/subject mapping, additive auth_families/
challenges/refresh migration, hashed CSPRNG opaque tokens, expiry/revocation/logout,
atomic refresh replay-family revocation, fresh server capabilities/ownership,
no self-grant/operator privilege, safe in-process local transport/errors/logs.
No HTTP listener or deployment interface. No default launch administrator seed.

Executed final: 50 new Auth/security tests + 34 original schema regressions =
84 passed, zero failed/skipped/cancelled on PostgreSQL 17.11. Initial 41+34 and
second 48+34 also passed before final coverage/guards added. Five host scripts PASS.
Original schema source/hash/34-test artifact unchanged; no old benchmark/audit rerun.
Local T1–T9/T22 coverage is qualified in results/SUMMARY.md, not full threat-row,
real-provider/hosted/HTTP/RLS/CSRF acceptance. Code/SQL/tests/source hashes and exact
commands: docs/planning/goldberg-0.11/stage-6/LOCAL-AUTH-PROTOTYPE.md and
spikes/stage6-auth-local/results/. No Supabase, real credentials/users, production
retention/deletion, Android/APK/device, cloud, merge or release activity.

Original API/model untouched. Existing consumer review in LOCAL-CORE-ADOPTION.md
reused: changes_requested canonical, draft device-local, returned UI label only;
old C6 broader guard/evidence preserved. Patch remains for owner review. Auth work
was independent and authorized; no formal policy exception applied.

Next, only after separate owner scope: local 6.4 typed bounded submissions/revisions
with full validation; 6.5 authenticated atomic moderation using this context and
existing lock/head design; 6.6 request-bound idempotency/replay/mismatch/expiry.
Do not automatically proceed. Q1/D5b unresolved/blocking; C4/C2 §12 OPEN;
6.0f/6.1–6.18 UNCHECKED; 6.0d/6.0e NOT AUTHORIZED; 0 CZK/month; collection NOT
AUTHORIZED. Stage 7A conditional/X10 OPEN, Stage 7B untouched. Issue checkpoint
and minimal latest-link dashboard proposal will be published/prepared after commit;
description edits require explicit approval and fresh conflict check.

## Current checkpoint — approved dashboard and adoption preparation (2026-10-22)

Base f54881e on spike/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-schema-pg. Owner-approved exact Issue
#31 Stage 6 row/latest-checkpoint edit PUBLISHED; independent readback PASS:
9,592 Unicode characters/52 lines, 2026-10-22T20:58:16Z, UTF-8 SHA-256
`dd2829c6576e9648396505c9cd87e70e3ae8667e4f35a7ac571bb90e59e35f2a`.
All 64 existing comment records and metadata/Project In Progress preserved at
publication. Other stage rows and all gates unchanged. Supersedes prior pending
9,564-character dashboard baseline below.

Owner reviewed the prototype and selected draft=device-local only,
changes_requested=canonical author-revision server state, returned=UI label only
if needed. Dependency review COMPLETE before any API edit: prototype already
matches; old isolated C6 simulator permits all three; no matching current app or
Stage 7A consumer found. Unknown external consumers are not proven absent. Approved
API/model text and old simulator/evidence remain unchanged.

Concrete adoption/compatibility report:
docs/planning/goldberg-0.11/stage-6/LOCAL-CORE-ADOPTION.md. Includes exact proposed
API patch and narrow local 6.1–6.3 authorization text under adoption-proposals/.
These are REVIEW DRAFTS, not policy in force. Reuse the hash-verified 34/34 prototype
for local 6.1, then fake-clock/JWKS/session Auth 6.2 and server capability/ownership
AuthZ 6.3. No actual extraction, new Auth/AuthZ code or formal 6.1 start this session.

Exact required owner decision: approve local-only formal 6.1–6.3 ahead of 6.0f,
amending only that subset's ordering in CHECKLIST/D8b, OPEN-DECISIONS,
CLOUD-READINESS-PLAN and POSTGRESQL-DESIGN-REQUIREMENTS. 6.0f stays OPEN/UNCHECKED;
ORD-A/cloud gates remain unchanged. Separately approve the API patch after reviewing
compatibility impact. This is needed because the current rule still says before
any implementation; prototype review alone does not amend it. No general audit
or replanning prerequisite; the concrete approval is the next action.

Q1/D5b unresolved/blocking; C4/C2 §12 OPEN; 6.0f/6.1–6.18 UNCHECKED;
6.0d/6.0e NOT AUTHORIZED; 0 CZK/month; collection NOT AUTHORIZED. Stage 5/7 and
unrelated worktrees/files preserved. Tested SQL/source/runner hashes unchanged;
34/34 historical evidence reused, no repeated PG benchmarks or hosted operations.
Publication/checkpoint SHA is the containing documentation commit on this branch.

## Local prototype publication — 2026-10-22

Verified source commit: 16bfdfbe213ce66973a55d9746453601605e74d7.
Verified diagnostic-format correction: f91a4ced846ad53a571c744c6c588f245fe3a582.
Both pushed to spike/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-schema-pg; tested source hashes unchanged.
[Issue #31 checkpoint](https://github.com/stokonn/Goldberg/issues/31#issuecomment-6351050432) posted under owner/workflow authorization, then
independently fetched and matched exactly. All 63 older comment records preserved;
64 total; labels/milestone/state and Project In Progress unchanged. Readiness branch
4d01489, Stage 7A 576f0d2 and all unrelated worktrees/files preserved.

Dashboard row/link proposal prepared in ignored .gradle/supabase-security-audit/
prototype-proposed-dashboard.md and shown for explicit owner approval. Currently
UNPUBLISHED; description remains 9,564 characters/52 lines with SHA-256
b3a49d6bf39b7181fd675765d3d5d8fff16d04f637ced2bddc69494c4df48549.
Before any approved body write, re-fetch for conflicts and preserve all other rows.

Formal Stage 6 remains unstarted. Local prototype milestone COMPLETE; Q1/D5b/C4/
C2 §12/6.0f still open, 6.1–6.18 unchecked; no automatic promotion, deployment,
OAuth or collection. Next: owner review of schema/contracts; formal adoption only
after gate clearance and separate approval. Full verification and the whitespace
workflow correction are in docs/ai/VERIFICATION.md; source/evidence in prototype
results/SUMMARY.md. This publication record is identified by its containing commit.

## Current Stage 6 checkpoint — local schema prototype (2026-10-22, base 4d01489)

Owner explicitly authorized isolated local-only synthetic prototype implementation,
not formal 6.1. Branch: `spike/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-schema-pg`, separate clone
`.gradle/stage6-schema-prototype`. Readiness branch remains at 4d01489; Stage 5
and Stage 7A worktrees/code/evidence untouched. Containing implementation commit
identifies this checkpoint; exact publication SHA follows in branch history.

Implemented `spikes/stage6-schema-pg`: two versioned/checksummed migrations for all
community entities, FK/unique/check graph, immutable revision/review/publication/
audit/feed history, revision hash chain, audit_head serialization, idempotency
storage and bounded local transaction exerciser; disposable PG17 runner, safe int8
conversion, independent audit export verification and targeted tests.

Executed: final clean PostgreSQL 17.11 run 34/34 PASS, zero failed/skipped; five
repository host checks PASS. Empty/seeded/repeat/concurrent/failing migration,
orphans/uniqueness, immutable mutation/truncation, six rollback boundaries,
same/different-submission target contention, named-key collision recovery/replay/
expiry, audit tamper/head/role checks, int8 boundaries and lock-timeout regression.
Earlier SQL/fixture/setup failures are preserved separately, not final failures.
No old PG/SQLite concurrency benchmarks repeated; original e37ed00/c21e550 evidence
untouched. No Supabase/production RLS/Auth/OAuth, full restore/RPO, app/APK/device
checks or deployment performed. Disposable prototype containers removed.

Contract discrepancy: API revisions permit draft/changes_requested/returned;
server model defines draft local-only and changes_requested → in_review only.
No new transition or approved API edit. Owner review required before adoption.

Evidence/recovery: docs/planning/goldberg-0.11/stage-6/LOCAL-SCHEMA-PROTOTYPE.md
and spikes/stage6-schema-pg/results/SUMMARY.md, final.tap, environment/source hashes.
Next: review this candidate for eventual 6.1, reconcile contract statuses, obtain
explicit 6.0f acceptance and separate formal implementation approval. Stop any
hosted/credential/gate-policy action without its phase-scoped authorization.
Q1/D5b unresolved/blocking; C4/C2 §12 OPEN; 6.0f/6.1–6.18 UNCHECKED;
6.0d/6.0e NOT AUTHORIZED; 0 CZK/month; real-user collection NOT AUTHORIZED.
Stage 7A conditional/X10 OPEN; Stage 7B untouched. Implementation commit/push and
existing Issue #31 checkpoint authorized by the owner/workflow; significant body
edits require review. Issue publication status is recorded in the next checkpoint.

## Live Supabase evidence and bounded readiness verdict — 2026-10-22 (base 31e0539)

Externally executed by ChatGPT’s connected Supabase integration, relayed by the
owner; not queried by this coding agent: ensure_rls → public.rls_auto_enable(),
normal dependency n; function also depends on plpgsql/public. Both API roles lack
CREATE in auth/extensions/graphql/graphql_public/public/realtime/storage/vault.
Private deployed-definition review confirms pinned pg_catalog, public restriction,
CREATE TABLE filtering, quoted identifiers, RLS logic and exception handling; this
is structural evidence, not complete safety proof. Inventory found ensure_rls plus
six Supabase-related system triggers, unchanged. Advisor rerun reports
anon_security_definer_function_executable and
authenticated_security_definer_function_executable both WARN, targeting the
function; unresolved. No exploit demonstrated/repaired or hosted mutation.

Current ledger/checklist/verdict: docs/planning/goldberg-0.11/stage-6/SECURITY-AUTH-READINESS-AUDIT.md
§1/§3/§9 supersede the earlier pending dependency/schema/source-structure/warning-name
items. Do not repeat A1–A3 or completed inventory/dependency/schema queries.

Plugin discovery: Supabase installed/ENABLED, but no callable Supabase tools exposed
here. Auth/API provider, signup, redirect, session/MFA, exposure and SSL/network
flags remain UNVERIFIED. No credentials, user records, raw definitions or broader
access requested. Next authorized step: one bounded sanitized settings pass through
an existing session with the required read tools; retain inaccessible fields as
limitations, then stop exploratory catalog work and resolve approval decisions.

Readiness: NOT authorized for backend implementation. Priorities: (1) owner obtains
Q1/D5b professional eligibility decision; (2) C4 transfer/retention/legal and
billing/payment/0-CZK evidence plus fresh review; (3) separately authorized C2 §12
verification and explicit 6.0f acceptance; (4) explicit implementation authorization.
A bounded Auth/API review and owner disposition of remaining WARN/unknowns are
security acceptance inputs, not permission to alter grants/triggers/functions.
Q1/D5b unresolved/blocking; C4/C2 §12 OPEN; 6.0f/6.1–6.18 UNCHECKED;
6.0d/6.0e NOT AUTHORIZED; ORD-A sequencing only; 0 CZK/month; real-user collection
NOT AUTHORIZED. Backend NOT IMPLEMENTED; Worker NOT DEPLOYED.

Issue #31 needs no material correction and stays unchanged (9,564 characters/52
lines, 63 comments; body SHA-256
b3a49d6bf39b7181fd675765d3d5d8fff16d04f637ced2bddc69494c4df48549).
Stage 7A conditional/X10 OPEN and Stage 7B not started remain untouched. Dedicated
branch docs/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-readiness; this checkpoint is its containing commit.

Eight-file documentation/link/gate/SQL checks and five existing host checks PASS.
Exact commands/limitations: docs/ai/VERIFICATION.md. Documentation-only publication
is authorized; no hosted or application test is implied.

## Additional external catalog inventories — 2026-10-22 (base 9fe83db)

ChatGPT executed four further read-only Supabase catalog queries; results were
relayed by the owner, not executed by this coding agent. Public functions: only
rls_auto_enable(). Direct anon/authenticated memberships: none returned. Function
dependency count: 1 (identity/type/direction not supplied). Public tables, views,
materialized views and foreign tables: zero objects. No database writes or
application-function invocation. Exact evidence and reconciled checklist:
docs/planning/goldberg-0.11/stage-6/SECURITY-AUTH-READINESS-AUDIT.md §1/§3/§8.

These scoped observations supersede corresponding pending inventories below.
They do not prove full security, eliminate all indirect DDL paths, establish
complete dependency/source safety or resolve either advisor warning. PUBLIC
EXECUTE remains observed despite no direct API-role memberships. Keep ensure_rls.
Do not repeat A1–A3 or these four inventories without a concrete reason.

Next authorized read-only work: resolve dependency identity/type/direction and
remaining cross-schema/DDL privilege paths, complete private body review, then
allowlisted Auth/provider/redirect/session/MFA and API-exposure flags (§3 B/C).
Other-schema RLS/grants, raw advisor IDs/version, billing/payment and C4 legal
requirements remain open. No secrets, user records, function/RPC or DDL probes.
Future permissions changes need separate authorization and compatibility review.

Issue #31 remains accurate and unchanged: 9,564 Unicode characters/52 lines,
SHA-256 b3a49d6bf39b7181fd675765d3d5d8fff16d04f637ced2bddc69494c4df48549;
63 comments preserved. No dashboard edit or checkpoint comment is necessary for
these scoped inventory details; the dashboard already links the living checklist.

Q1/D5b unresolved/blocking; C4 and C2 §12 OPEN; 6.0f/6.1–6.18 UNCHECKED;
6.0d/6.0e NOT AUTHORIZED; ORD-A sequencing only; 0 CZK/month; real-user collection
NOT AUTHORIZED. Production backend NOT IMPLEMENTED; Worker NOT DEPLOYED. Stage 7A
conditional/X10 OPEN and 7B not started remain unchanged. Branch:
`docs/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-readiness`; checkpoint SHA is its containing commit.

Eight-file documentation consistency/link/gate/SQL-preservation checks and the
five existing host scripts PASS; see docs/ai/VERIFICATION.md for exact commands
and limitations. No hosted checks or completed concurrency tests rerun by this agent.

## External A1–A3 continuation — 2026-10-22 (base bac81fb)

A1–A3 EXECUTED successfully by ChatGPT’s connected Supabase integration; results
relayed by the owner, not executed by this coding agent. Evidence ledger and
partial-completion checklist: docs/planning/goldberg-0.11/stage-6/SECURITY-AUTH-READINESS-AUDIT.md.
OID 17603 is plpgsql/SECURITY DEFINER/postgres/event_trigger with search_path
pg_catalog and anon/authenticated effective EXECUTE. ensure_rls binds that OID,
ddl_command_end, normal mode O, tags CREATE TABLE/CREATE TABLE AS/SELECT INTO.
API roles lack the six reported superuser/role/CREATE capabilities; postgres has
BYPASSRLS and public/database CREATE, but rolsuper=false. Default PUBLIC EXECUTE
was observed; no separate anon/authenticated grants identified. Structural body
checks are partial, not proof of safety. Both advisor warnings remain unresolved;
no exploit demonstrated or repaired, no function/RPC invocation or database writes.

This supersedes earlier pending language/path/binding/A1–A3 statements below.
Auth/API flags, inherited-role and remaining DDL paths, complete source/dependency
review, actual advisor IDs/version and billing/payment evidence remain UNVERIFIED.
Next independently authorized step: those remaining sanitized catalog/private
source checks, then allowlisted Auth/API flags through the existing authorized
connection. No callable Supabase tools here; do not repeat A1–A3 or request secrets.
Any future function-specific PUBLIC ACL reduction requires separate write approval,
compatibility review and rollback design; preserve ensure_rls.

Q1/D5b unresolved/blocking; C4 and C2 §12 OPEN; 6.0f/6.1–6.18 UNCHECKED;
6.0d/6.0e NOT AUTHORIZED; ORD-A sequencing only; 0 CZK/month; collection NOT
AUTHORIZED. No production backend, Worker deployment or Stage 7 changes. This
checkpoint is identified by its containing documentation commit on
`docs/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-readiness`.

### Published Issue #31 baseline and verification

Owner approved only the A1–A3 C4 audit-sentence replacement. Fresh pre-write body,
metadata and comments matched the inspected baseline; exact published readback PASS.
[Issue #31](https://github.com/stokonn/Goldberg/issues/31): **9,564 Unicode characters / 52 lines**,
updated 2026-10-22T20:09:06Z; UTF-8 SHA-256
`b3a49d6bf39b7181fd675765d3d5d8fff16d04f637ced2bddc69494c4df48549`.
Previous baseline: 9,442 characters / 52 lines; change +122 characters, one sentence
only. All 63 full comment records, labels/milestone/state/title/assignees/lock and
Goldberg Development Project In Progress preserved; no checkpoint comment added.
This is the current conflict-check baseline; older baselines below are historical.

Five existing host checks PASS: agent policy; 3 backup fixtures; history paging
106 sessions/4 pages; localization 922 EN/CZ resources; migration DDL v1–9→10.
Migration/bridge Android runtime coverage is not supplied by these host checks.
Nine Markdown files only; local links, git diff --check, unchanged original
stage/gate checkboxes and non-Stage-6 sections PASS. Original SQL blocks and the
remaining Auth/API task lists are unchanged. No hosted SQL/function/RPC/DDL by this
agent, application build/device test, screenshots, cloud changes or completed
PostgreSQL/SQLite concurrency reruns. Documentation publication is authorized on
the dedicated branch; use this checkpoint’s containing commit as the source SHA.

## Previous security-audit checkpoint and Issue baseline — 2026-10-22

Read-only documentary audit completed from 4f0cd51 on
`docs/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-readiness`; actual hosted verification checklist remains
UNEXECUTED. Use SECURITY-AUTH-READINESS-AUDIT.md for source-attributed facts,
conditional risk analysis, recommendation and next catalog reads A1–A3.
Owner-approved single C4-sentence update published and exact readback verified:
9,442 Unicode characters/52 lines, 2026-10-22T19:56:59Z; SHA-256
`2abc94feba38ded15eccb75b9bc61c884dff3c6d973e432db2190c23e9cb50dc`. All 63 comments,
Issue metadata and Project In Progress preserved. No new comments. This supersedes
older dashboard baselines for future conflict checks. All Stage 6 gates unchanged.

Five host checks and Markdown scope/link/unchanged-checkbox checks PASS; three
catalog SELECT drafts statically reviewed only. No Supabase SQL/functions/RPC, DDL,
Auth mutation, grants, event-trigger change, application tests, screenshots or
completed concurrency/research-suite reruns. This checkpoint is carried by its
containing documentation commit; publication SHA is resolved from branch history.

## Security & Auth read-only audit — 2026-10-22 (base 4f0cd51)

Owner-supplied catalog facts: public.rls_auto_enable() is SECURITY DEFINER, owned
by postgres, executable by anon/authenticated, returns event_trigger; ensure_rls
is an enabled DDL event trigger; no public application tables. This agent did not
execute those hosted checks. Exact advisor IDs, language/body/search_path, grant
provenance, DDL rights and API/Auth configuration remain unverified.

Official Supabase and PG17 guidance/source reviewed: direct PL/pgSQL callback calls
are rejected outside trigger context; existing hooks can still fire on matching
non-superuser DDL. Excess privileges do not establish exploitability. Preserve the
RLS guard; inspect metadata/body safely before considering separately authorized,
function-specific ACL/search-path hardening. No grants, functions, event triggers,
OAuth settings or resources changed; no function/RPC/DDL probe or user-row read.

Current analysis, read-only checklist, A1–A3 catalog SELECTs and source references:
docs/planning/goldberg-0.11/stage-6/SECURITY-AUTH-READINESS-AUDIT.md. Hosted checklist
NOT EXECUTED (no callable Supabase tools in this session). Next independently
authorized task is those allowlisted metadata reads through an existing authorized
connection, not a mutation or privilege-escalation test. Owner approved the single C4-sentence Issue update; exact publication and
verification are recorded above and in the audit document.

Q1/D5b unresolved/blocking; C4 and C2 §12 OPEN; 6.0f/6.1–6.18 UNCHECKED;
6.0d/6.0e NOT AUTHORIZED; ORD-A sequencing only; 0 CZK/month. Stage 7 unchanged.

## Current Issue #31 baseline after Supabase reconciliation — 2026-10-22

Published with explicit owner authorization; verified at 2026-10-22T19:41:30Z:
9,276 Unicode characters/52 lines; exact UTF-8 SHA-256
`970b5a9e1dbcc632fba28403d440a4ec6183ddc6b48720d0dd30784566699328`.
Only C4 observation text changed. All 63 comment records and Issue metadata
unchanged; Goldberg Development remains In Progress. No new checkpoint comment.
Supersedes the older 8,925-character baseline for future conflict comparisons.

## Existing Supabase project — externally verified reconciliation (2026-10-22)

The owner relayed verification by **ChatGPT's connected Supabase integration** on
2026-10-22: existing organization/project identity, organization Free/`tier_free`,
project Frankfurt (`eu-central-1`), `ACTIVE_HEALTHY`, PostgreSQL 17.11, **0 public
tables, 0 recorded migrations, 0 Edge Functions**. These are externally verified
observations; **this coding agent did not execute those checks**. Display names
stay in ignored local notes under the public no-account-identifiers policy.
This session still exposes no callable Supabase tools; that capability limitation
does not negate the separate external verification.

Billing/payment methods, quota usage, Auth providers/security, direct database
connectivity from this agent and non-public schema configuration remain **UNVERIFIED**.
Zero public tables is not proof that every schema is empty or that Auth is disabled.
Production backend **NOT IMPLEMENTED** in the verified repository; Cloudflare Worker
**NOT DEPLOYED** in the verified record. Google OAuth not configured in Goldberg's
implementation record; hosted Google configuration UNVERIFIED. Real-user collection
**NOT AUTHORIZED**. Do not create another project or modify the existing one.

Q1/D5b, C4, C2 §12 and 6.0f remain **OPEN** (6.0f UNCHECKED); 6.0d/6.0e **NOT
AUTHORIZED**, 6.1–6.18 UNCHECKED; ORD-A sequencing only; 0 CZK/month permanently.
Project existence does not complete/authorize 6.0d. Q1-C denotes the operational
hold, not zero-resource inventory; no operator option is selected. Prior zero-project
observations are historical. Stage 7A conditional/X10 OPEN and 7B not started stay
unchanged; no Stage 7 work is performed here.

Current checklist and metadata inventory: docs/planning/goldberg-0.11/stage-6/
C4-PREPROVISIONING-CHECKLIST.md §H and READINESS-CONTINUATION.md reconciliation
entry. Base eab990b on docs/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-readiness; no newer remote commit
or conflicting local work at recovery. Issue #31 still matched the verified
8,925-character baseline on recovery; latest checkpoint 6349209052. The owner approved the C4-bullet update and its subsequent external-verification
correction; the exact published body and validation are recorded in C4 §H.
No new Issue comment was added.

## Issue #31 dashboard baseline — published and verified 2026-10-22

Owner approved the exact editorial draft; only the Issue description was replaced.
[Current dashboard](https://github.com/stokonn/Goldberg/issues/31), verified at
2026-10-22T19:23:54Z: **8,925 Unicode characters, 52 lines**, down from 25,489
characters/136 lines (64.98% character reduction). Exact UTF-8 body SHA-256:
`c6fabfe7efefa331472fab9e1ba70ea4418bafe6dfedaa02e644e34c138318b7`.
Pre-write body matched the reviewed baseline; post-write body matched the approved
draft exactly. All 63 full comment records unchanged; no new comments. Labels,
milestone 4, title, state, assignees and lock state unchanged; Goldberg Development
item remains In Progress. This supersedes earlier editorial approval-pending notes.

For future edits, fetch current body/comments and compare with this baseline;
review unrelated changes before writing, preserve evidence and update the baseline
after verified publication. The Issue is current status/navigation, repository
docs hold specifications, and comments remain chronological history.

Technical gates unchanged: Q1/D5b unresolved/blocking; C4 and C2 §12 OPEN; 6.0f
and 6.1–6.18 UNCHECKED; 6.0d/6.0e NOT AUTHORIZED; ORD-A sequencing only;
0 CZK/month. Stage 7A conditional/X10 OPEN; 7B not started. No new implementation,
merge, deployment, release or application changes. Next product actions remain
owner-routed Q1 review and owner-performed X10; no physical-device work by agents.

## Current Stage 6 continuation — 2026-10-22 (documentation only)


## Finalization publication checkpoint — 2026-10-22

The owner explicitly authorized this documentation-only finalization. Reviewed
12 Markdown files; all five host scripts re-executed and PASS; local relative
links, unchanged original task checkboxes and preservation of other stage sections
verified; git diff --check PASS. Source documentation commit
[6c40799](https://github.com/stokonn/Goldberg/commit/6c40799fefa331385c394fb621e72a5a62c20423)
was pushed to docs/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-readiness and exact remote SHA verified.
Prepared continuation checkpoint posted unchanged at
[comment 6349066370](https://github.com/stokonn/Goldberg/issues/31#issuecomment-6349066370).
This containing documentation commit records publication evidence; consult the
branch HEAD and the finalization Issue comment for its exact revision.

Issue dashboard editorial draft prepared from the latest body and all 62 comments,
including Stage 7A conditional acceptance 6346899885; all 19 unique links checked
live. Snapshot/proposal/link report stored locally at
/home/stokonn/Projects/Opus/.gradle/issue31-cleanup/. No description replacement
until owner approval of the final draft; re-fetch immediately before any approved
write and stop on unrelated edits. Original comments remain untouched.

All technical gates unchanged: Q1/D5b unresolved/blocking; C4 OPEN; C2 §12 OPEN;
6.0f UNCHECKED; 6.1–6.18 UNCHECKED; 6.0d/6.0e NOT AUTHORIZED; ORD-A sequencing
only; 0 CZK/month. Stage 7A conditional/X10 OPEN, 7B not started (latest separate
Stage 7 branch); no Stage 7 code or evidence modified. No Gradle, APK, screenshots,
emulator, hosted-runtime or new spike execution. No merge/tag/release/provisioning.

This entry supersedes earlier retrieval/next-action summaries only; historical
checkpoints below remain preserved. Base planning b3edc2a; completed spike c21e550;
prior Issue checkpoint 6348121556. Owner-approved Stage 6-only Issue description
sync applied and exact-body readback passed. Issue #31 and milestone 4 OPEN;
Project Goldberg Development item In Progress (verified, unchanged).

Current working checkout: /home/stokonn/Projects/Opus/.gradle/stage6-continuation,
branch docs/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-readiness, based on b3edc2a.
Owner explicitly authorized verified documentation commit/push in the finalization
instruction; publication evidence will be appended after remote verification.
Read docs/planning/goldberg-0.11/stage-6/READINESS-CONTINUATION.md first for the
session checklist, sources, owner actions and verification; then
POSTGRESQL-DESIGN-REQUIREMENTS.md for future 6.1 requirements. Completed spike
results preserved and NOT rerun. C4 PDF text parsed (22 entries); Trust Center
opened but TIA not retrieved/Free access unverified; official GDPR retrieval still
challenged; exact provider metadata retention and Supabase billing remain open.
Corrected stale no-account wording in the professional-review brief to preserve
owner-created account facts. No identity, credentials or console evidence added.

Next: owner routes the existing professional-review brief for Q1/D5b; obtain TIA
and retention clarification privately, finish documentary transfer review and
Supabase no-payment confirmation without provisioning. No contact sent. New Issue
checkpoint [posted with owner authorization](https://github.com/stokonn/Goldberg/issues/31#issuecomment-6349066370);
local text preserved in docs/ai/STAGE6-ISSUE-CHECKPOINT-DRAFT.md as a historical
snapshot. No automatic compaction-to-GitHub synchronization assumed.
No merge is authorized. Issue description cleanup requires final draft approval.

Verification in this continuation: five existing Python host checks PASS
(policy, 3 backup fixtures, 106-session/4-page paging, 922 EN/CZ resources,
v1–9→10 DDL); git diff --check and document/scope checks PASS. These are host
checks only. No Gradle, APK, lint, instrumentation, emulator, hosted runtime or
billing tests executed; no screenshots inspected. Only verified documentation
commit/push is authorized; production gates remain unchanged.

Q1/D5b UNRESOLVED and blocking; C4 OPEN; C2 §12 OPEN; 6.0f UNCHECKED;
6.1–6.18 UNCHECKED; 6.0d/6.0e NOT AUTHORIZED; ORD-A sequencing only;
permanent 0 CZK/month. No production implementation, deployment, project, billing,
real-user data, merge, tag or release. No device/emulator tests or screenshots.

## 🚦 Current status: awaiting owner approval (Phase C gate)

- The Stage 5 emulator verification workflow was **revised and CI-only PR prepared**:
  draft [PR #32](https://github.com/stokonn/Goldberg/pull/32), branch
  `ci/stage5-emulator-verification` (based on `origin/main`), commit `9870d99` —
  **workflow-only diff (1 file), NOT merged**.
- **Phase B findings fixed in the workflow** (details in `docs/ai/VERIFICATION.md`
  CI-activation section): in-place upgrade now uses a same-keystore debug rebuild of
  the v0.10.1 tag (CI debug can never install over the release-signed APK; trusted cert
  `53eface4…` apksigner-verified); the invalid `cmd netpolicy set data_saver enable`
  was replaced with AOSP-verified `set/get restrict-background` + `dumpsys` state
  assertions; Wi-Fi→mobile transition now asserts transport + network-ID change;
  process death now includes pulled-DB `PRAGMA integrity_check/foreign_key_check/
  user_version`; source commit SHA recorded+asserted in both jobs; 30-day evidence
  retention. The identical revised workflow is committed on this Stage 5 branch too
  (so a `workflow_dispatch` against `feature/goldberg-0.11-stage-5` uses the fixed
  version).
- **STOPPED here per owner instruction:** merging PR #32 into `main` and manually
  dispatching the workflow both require explicit owner approval. Until then: no CI run,
  no instrumentation, no 5.11 evidence. Tasks 5.10–5.13 remain open.
- This checkpoint commit contains **only** the revised `.github/workflows/stage5-emulator.yml`
  (identical to PR #32's file) and documentation sync (`docs/ai/STATE.md`,
  `docs/ai/VERIFICATION.md`, `docs/ai/HANDOFF.md`,
  `docs/planning/goldberg-0.11/STAGE-CHECKLIST.md`) — **no application/test source
  changes**.

## ⚠️ Emulator blocker on the desktop machine (2026-10-20, third session)

Task 5.10/5.11 are **blocked by a host-level Android emulator bug on this desktop**:

- This is a **different machine** than the notebook (Fedora, kernel
  `7.2.10-200.fc44.x86_64`, Java 25, 15 GiB RAM, no cmdline-tools, no stage5 AVD).
- The desktop's only pre-existing AVD (`Medium_Phone_API_37.0`, google_apis_playstore)
  and a freshly created notebook-style AVD (`stage5-api36`, google_apis API 36 x86_64,
  r07 — installed via newly added cmdline-tools 12.0) were both tried.
- **Every headless boot attempt ends in `Killed by SIGSEGV`** of the qemu process a few
  minutes into guest boot, right after the persistent
  `WARNING: cannnot unmap ptr … as it is in the protected range …` line. Configurations
  tried (all with explicit serial `emulator-5580`, never a physical device):
  API 37 + swiftshader ×2, API 36 + swiftshader (emulator 37.2.12), API 36 + `-gpu auto`
  (lavapipe/swangle, 37.2.12), API 36 + swiftshader (emulator **37.3.4** canary, newest
  published build, installed side-by-side at `~/Android/Sdk/emulator-37.3.4`). One
  API 37 run with lavapipe/swangle stayed alive 13 min but the guest never completed
  boot (`adb` stuck offline).
- This matches the known upstream bug **Google Issue Tracker #566807521** ("Android
  Emulator crashes with Segmentation fault during headless boot on modern Linux/Fedora",
  same protected-range warning, KVM present, independent of GPU option). Not fixed in
  37.3.4.
- Conclusion: **no emulator on this desktop can currently boot**; tasks 5.10/5.11 cannot
  be executed here. No instrumentation tests were executed. Possible paths (owner
  decision): run 5.10/5.11 on the notebook (its `stage5-api36` AVD booted fine), wait for
  an upstream emulator fix, or try a pre-37 emulator binary (not offered by the SDK
  channel; direct-zip install would need owner approval).

- Branch `feature/goldberg-0.11-stage-5`, parent `54f2b45` + Stage 5 checkpoint commits.
  **Pushed to origin as owner-authorized IN-PROGRESS checkpoints** (verification
  incomplete — see VERIFICATION.md for what remains unexecuted). No merge/tag/release.
  The third-session checkpoint is **docs-only** (this file, HANDOFF, VERIFICATION,
  STAGE-CHECKLIST): it records the desktop emulator blocker + host-gate evidence and
  adds no production/test code changes.
- In the second-session checkpoint commit (`c61cf12`):
  - `M app/src/androidTest/java/com/opus/piano/Stage5BundleJobRunnerTest.kt` — compile fixes,
    fixture corrections, F1 retarget (owner-approved, test-only).
  - `M app/src/main/java/com/opus/piano/data/offline/BundleStore.kt` — F2 fix
    (owner-approved): installBlob dedup now verifies existing target length+sha256; invalid
    bytes moved to quarantine (`dedup_corrupt`, never deleted), verified staged copy installed
    so the same attempt repairs; quarantine-rename failure returns false (fail-safe).
  - `?? app/src/androidTest/java/com/opus/piano/Stage5BundleWorkerTest.kt` — 12-test draft,
    L324 nullable `TestDriver?` compile error FIXED (`?.setAllConstraintsMet`, assertions
    unchanged).
  - `?? docs/ai/*` — this checkpoint (STATE/VERIFICATION/HANDOFF/DECISIONS).
  - `M docs/planning/goldberg-0.11/STAGE-CHECKLIST.md` — Stage 5 progress notes.

## Executed this session (2026-10-20, third resume session — desktop) — real results

1. Environment re-verified: branch `feature/goldberg-0.11-stage-5` at `c61cf12`, in sync
   with origin; untracked private files (`.pmp/`, `.pmp.yml`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`,
   `docs/planning/goldberg-0.11/stage-4/checkpoint-archive/`) untouched and NOT committed.
2. **EXECUTED** `./gradlew --no-daemon --max-workers=1 :app:assembleDebug
   :app:assembleDebugAndroidTest` → **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** (1m08s, Java 25 host; only the
   known nullable-`listFiles()` warnings). Fresh APKs: `app-debug.apk` 32,388,569 bytes
   (sha256 `44222c59b89ed63041d1e105f074857f5ca3c2f93efef4a9ed0eea115dd0a157`),
   `app-debug-androidTest.apk` 1,331,040 bytes (sha256
   `6030e528474334ae31f0514c0f818aeeb68dcf3f9b2ac35e453762d1e5ba8f2d`), both Oct 20 21:13.
   (These were rebuilt because the desktop's pre-existing outputs were from a different
   build context; they are Stage-5 source-faithful.)
3. Emulator toolchain: cmdline-tools 12.0 installed (side-effect: fixes sdkmanager/
   avdmanager on this desktop), `system-images;android-36;google_apis;x86_64` r07
   installed, AVD `stage5-api36` created in `~/.android/avd`. Emulator 37.3.4 downloaded
   side-by-side (SDK's 37.2.12 untouched). **All boot attempts SIGSEGV — see blocker
   section above. Zero instrumentation executed; APKs not installed (no device to install
   to; the earlier installs were on the notebook's now-unavailable emulator).**
4. **EXECUTED** `scripts/check_agent_policy.py`, `check_backup_fixtures.py`,
   `check_history_paging.py`, `check_localization.py`, `check_migrations.py` → **ALL PASS**
   (exit 0; see VERIFICATION.md row detail).
5. **EXECUTED** full host gate
   (`clean assembleDebug testDebugUnitTest assembleDebugAndroidTest lintDebug`) →
   **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** (3m24s): unit tests **174/0/0/0** (30 classes), lint
   **0 errors / 110 warnings** (2 in Stage 5 offline code). Clean-build `app-debug.apk`
   22,508,542 B — same byte size as the notebook checkpoint APK (source-identity
   evidence). Task 5.12 host-side portion therefore executed and passing; 5.12 stays
   open only as a formality until 5.10/5.11 evidence exists for the final re-run.
6. **GUI-mode emulator attempt (owner-requested, one controlled configuration)** —
   first launch failed before QEMU started (tool shell lacked `XAUTHORITY`); relaunched
   with the session's `/run/user/1000/.mutter-Xwaylandauth.*` → Qt window opened on the
   GNOME desktop, then **`Killed by SIGSEGV` again** after the protected-range warning.
   GUI mode does not avoid the bug → **all local emulator retries stopped** (owner
   instruction). Details in VERIFICATION.md row 11.
7. **CI investigation + workflow prepared (not yet committed/pushed — pending owner
   approval)** — GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-24.04` runners support KVM-accelerated Android
   emulation (GitHub Changelog 2024-04-02) and
   `reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner` v2.38.0 is current. Prepared
   `.github/workflows/stage5-emulator.yml`: **`workflow_dispatch` only** (no automatic
   runs), `permissions: contents: read`, SHA-pinned actions, KVM enable step, explicit
   `emulator-NNNN` serial + `ro.kernel.qemu=1` guard with abort-on-multiple-devices.
   Job 5.10 runs the **complete** `connectedDebugAndroidTest` suite (no selection/
   skipping). Job 5.11 runs the CI-executable acceptance subset: digest-verified
   in-place upgrade from trusted 0.10.1 (script-asserted), Wi-Fi→mobile + Data Saver
   evidence, process death + cold restart with DB integrity check, 5× startup
   measurements, failure logcat capture. Explicitly NOT covered (notebook follow-up):
   consent revocation mid-stream, low disk, screenshot inspection, real bundle
   transfer costs. YAML validated (`yaml.safe_load` OK); helper scripts compile.

## Executed — second resume session (2026-10-20, battery emergency stop) — real results

1. Fixed the 1 open compile error (`Stage5BundleWorkerTest.kt:324` nullable TestDriver call).
2. **EXECUTED** `:app:assembleDebugAndroidTest` → **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** (2m02s, 0 errors;
   only the 7+ known nullable-`listFiles()` warnings).
3. **EXECUTED** `testDebugUnitTest --rerun` → **174 tests / 0 failures / 0 errors / 0 skipped**
   (30 classes, fresh evidence).
4. **F1 + F2 fully investigated and confirmed against source; owner approved both recommended
   resolutions** (recorded in `docs/ai/DECISIONS.md`):
   - F1 retarget implemented: `invalidRightsOnDiskQuarantineManifestAndDeactivatesJob`
     (hand-tampered on-disk manifest → Permanent(manifest_missing), job deactivated, bytes
     preserved in quarantine, never READY). No production change.
   - F2 `BundleStore.installBlob` fix implemented (~15 lines incl. KDoc quarantine line).
5. **EXECUTED** `:app:testDebugUnitTest :app:assembleDebugAndroidTest` after F1/F2 changes →
   **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** (2m10s); fresh JVM counts **174 / 0** (reports regenerated 19:23).
6. **PMP investigated** (see section below) — actual state confirmed, nothing reinitialized.
7. Emulator setup: **EXECUTED** sdkmanager install of `emulator` (37.2.12.0) +
   `system-images;android-36;google_apis;x86_64` (r07); AVD `stage5-api36` created.
   **AVD home is redirected**: `/home/stokonn/.config/.android/avd` — the emulator binary
   needs `ANDROID_AVD_HOME=/home/stokonn/.config/.android/avd` or it fails with
   "Unknown AVD name". Booted **emulator-5580** headless (API 36, Android 16,
   `ro.kernel.qemu=1` — verified emulator, explicit serial, no physical phone ever used).
8. **EXECUTED** `:app:assembleDebug` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL (5m44s) after catching that the
   existing `app-debug.apk` was stale (Oct 16, pre-Stage-5). Fresh `app-debug.apk`
   (22,508,542 bytes, Oct 20 19:45) exists in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.
9. Installed to emulator-5580 (both `Success`) — but **before** the staleness catch, so the
   *installed* app APK was the stale one; **no instrumentation test was ever executed**.
   Emulator stopped safely on battery warning.

## PMP investigation result (question #6 — answered, NOT reinitialized)

- **PMP = Project Memory Protocol** — owner's public repo `stokonn/project-memory-protocol`
  (created 2026-10-19): "Local-first, agent-agnostic development memory, checkpoints and
  handoffs for Git projects" (Python CLI, `pmp init/status/resume/handoff`, XDG state dirs,
  `PMP_STATE_HOME` override).
- Evidence the earlier initialization succeeded: GitHub Issue #31 checkpoint comment (2026-10-20
  13:46Z) says "**PMP state local/private**"; the `docs/ai/*` HANDOFF/STATE/VERIFICATION/
  DECISIONS structure mirrors PMP's handoff style.
- **Why the previous session found nothing: no durable local trace exists anywhere now.**
  Verified absent: `pmp` CLI (PATH, `~/.local/bin`, pipx, `python3 -m pip`, uv); PMP state
  (`~/.local/state/pmp`, `~/.config/pmp`, `~/.local/share/pmp`, `~/.pmp`, `$PMP_STATE_HOME`
  unset); `.pmp/`/`.pmp.yml` in the working tree **or in any commit on any branch**; a local
  clone of the repo under `~/Projects` or `/tmp`. Conclusion: the earlier init evidently lived
  in an ephemeral location (e.g. /tmp or a since-removed worktree) or was deleted — PMP state
  is by design local/private and never committed, so its loss leaves no git trace.
- **Not reinitialized** (owner instruction: confirm state first). Re-init is an owner decision;
  `docs/ai/*` serves Stage 5 handoff in the meantime.

## Not executed / not claimed

- **All `Stage5*Test` instrumentation (tasks 5.10/5.11) — still zero tests executed; now
  blocked by the desktop emulator bug (see blocker section). The fresh APKs were built
  but not installed anywhere.**
- `lintDebug` is part of the running host gate (task 5.12) — see VERIFICATION.md.
- Emulator acceptance matrix (Wi-Fi→mobile, Data Saver, consent revocation mid-stream, real
  process death, low disk, seeded in-place upgrade from trusted 0.10.1, cost measurements).
- No screenshots, no physical phone (forbidden), no merge/tag/release (forbidden).

## Environment

Desktop (third session): Arch-notebook environment superseded — Fedora host, kernel
`7.2.10-200.fc44.x86_64`, Java 25 (Gradle 9.3.1 runs fine), 15 GiB RAM, SDK at
`~/Android/Sdk` (android-36 + android-37.0/37.2 images, build-tools 36.0.0, cmdline-tools
12.0, emulator 37.2.12 + side-by-side 37.3.4), AVDs in `~/.android/avd`
(`stage5-api36` google_apis API 36, `Medium_Phone_API_37.0` playstore). `/tmp` is a
small tmpfs (7.8 GiB) — do not unzip large archives there. All builds
`--no-daemon --max-workers=1`. All ADB calls require explicit `-s emulator-NNNN`.

## Prohibitions (still active)

No physical phone / implicit ADB device; explicit `emulator-NNNN` serial only. No push, tag,
merge, release or APK publication without separate authorization. Do not mark Stage 5 tasks
5.10–5.13 complete; do not start Stage 6. Never weaken test assertions; never fabricate results.

## Addendum — Stage 6 C6 contract spike (2026-10-22, isolated branch, local-only)

Owner-authorized local verification prototype executed on branch
`spike/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-contract` (from planning HEAD `c22adb1`; **planning
branch untouched, spike never merged**): `spikes/contract-c6/` — disposable
in-process `/v1` contract simulator (synthetic identities, fake sessions, fake
clock, per-run `node:sqlite`, zero npm deps, static scan PASS: no network
surface). Executed: **79 tests / 79 pass / 0 fail** (Node v22.23.1, run
2026-10-22T06:40Z; first run 69/79 → 10 root-caused failures fixed and
preserved in
[results/SUMMARY.md §1](https://github.com/stokonn/Goldberg/blob/d2a95d4b83c634aacb4f7f74432f2bd8980cf218/spikes/contract-c6/results/SUMMARY.md)
failure log — stable link at commit `d2a95d4`, the spike code stays isolated
on its branch). Covers THREAT-MODEL [L] rows T5–T18/T22
incl. 10-trial multi-process approve race (exactly one commit/trial), fault-
injection rollback, kill switch, quotas, SSRF static guard, audit chain.
**Not executed (precise blockers):** C2 §12 production runtime (provisioning
gate 6.0d: D5b unresolved, C4 open, ORD-A steps 4–6), all [I]-venue rows, real
Postgres isolation, HTTP/token layer (C2 S1–S19 reused), CPU (C2 measured),
tasks 6.1–6.18. **No gates changed: 6.0f UNCHECKED, 6.1–6.18 unchecked, no
accounts/provisioning/merge/tag/release, Stage 7 untouched, 0 CZK/month.**

## Addendum — Stage 6 Cloudflare MCP readiness verification CHECKPOINT #1 (2026-10-22, read-only)

Under an explicit owner instruction, the official **Cloudflare MCP server**
(OAuth, **read-only** permissions) was verified and used for a **read-only
inventory** of the owner-provisioned Cloudflare account. **No cloud resource
was created, modified or deleted; no OAuth permission, billing or account
setting was touched; no credential was accessed or recorded.** All calls were
GET. Non-identifying facts recorded (no email, account ID or credential in any
repository file):

- **MCP connection VERIFIED:** `GET /user` → HTTP 200 (success).
  `GET /user/tokens/verify` → 401 "Invalid API Token" is **expected** — that
  endpoint validates API tokens, not OAuth bearer sessions; not a defect.
- **Read-only scope evidence:** Workers R2 *read* scope present;
  **billing/subscription endpoints refused (403, no OAuth scope)** — billing
  state is **not inspectable** through this connection, and **inaccessible
  billing is explicitly NOT proof of zero costs** (the 0 CZK posture is
  enforced by the C4/ORD-A gates and the owner's accounting, never inferred
  from a tool limitation).
- **Account inventory (empty):** 1 standard account (created 2026-10-22, not
  suspended, no pro zones); **user-level 2FA ENABLED** (account-level
  2FA-enforcement flag off — relevant to D8c when actionable); **0 zones**;
  **0 Workers scripts**; **workers.dev subdomain NOT yet created** (404 /
  code 10007 — auto-created only on the first Workers & Pages dashboard
  visit; not performed); **0 D1 databases; 0 KV namespaces; R2 not enabled**
  (403 / code 10042 — not needed by the approved architecture).
- **Architecture comparison (C1):** a Workers Free verification Worker can be
  hosted when separately authorized; **nothing exists yet**; the
  no-custom-domain constraint is trivially satisfied (0 zones); **Supabase
  remains entirely unverified/unprovisioned from this side.**
- **Standing preserved:** the existing account does **NOT** resolve Q1/D5b —
  account eligibility, contractual capacity, authority-to-bind and the GDPR
  controller role all remain for professional review. **Q1/D5b UNRESOLVED
  and blocking for 6.0d; C4 OPEN; C2 §12 OPEN; 6.0f UNCHECKED; 6.0d/6.0e NOT
  AUTHORIZED; tasks 6.1–6.18 all unchecked; ORD-A sequencing-only; Stage 7
  untouched; Stage 5 remains COMPLETE; 0 CZK/month unchanged.**
  **Next steps:** (1) owner routes `Q1-PROFESSIONAL-REVIEW-BRIEF.md` to a
  qualified professional to resolve D5b; (2) only then, under a separate
  phase-scoped authorization (ORD-A steps 4–6 / CR-1…CR-5): day-of C4 →
  minimal verification resources → CR-6 measurements → CR-7 cleanup →
  owner acceptance/rejection of 6.0f.

## Addendum — Owner preference: Q1-D preferred operator model (2026-10-22, docs only)

The owner recorded **Q1-D (operation under their own name, as a legally
capable natural person acting in their own name) as the PREFERRED operator
model**, subject to contractual eligibility determination and professional
verification. **A directional preference only — NOT a selection, NOT an
approval, NOT a D5b resolution.** D5b stays **legally UNRESOLVED and blocking
for 6.0d** until the professional review (Q4.1–Q4.13 / C-1…C-6) returns and
the owner records the outcome; textual contract compatibility ≠ lawfulness;
no account may be created; ORD-A stays sequencing-only; Q1-C remains the
operative posture (nothing provisioned); no personal data requested, recorded
or implied. Synchronized: `stage-6/Q1-OPERATOR-READINESS.md` (PREFERENCE
ADDENDUM), `OPEN-DECISIONS.md` (D5b row), `CLOUD-READINESS-PLAN.md` §4.1,
stage-6 `README.md`, `CHECKLIST.md` (6.0b + progress log),
`STAGE-CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/ai/HANDOFF.md`. **6.0f UNCHECKED; 6.0d/6.0e NOT
AUTHORIZED; 6.1–6.18 unchecked; C4 OPEN; C2 §12 OPEN; Stage 7 untouched;
Stage 5 remains COMPLETE; 0 CZK/month.**

## Addendum — C6-PG spike: contract tests verified on real local PostgreSQL (2026-10-22)

Branch `spike/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-contract-pg` (**never merged**; `f7bef8e`
code + `e37ed00` evidence) ran the SAME C6 contract suites against a real,
isolated, LOCAL **PostgreSQL 17.11** (rootless podman, `127.0.0.1:54329`
loopback-only, trust auth on loopback, default isolation **`read committed`**,
synthetic data only, per-test throwaway schemas; container removed after
evidence capture). **Results: PostgreSQL 86/86 pass / 0 fail (v1–v10);
SQLite post-port 79/79 / 0 fail + 7 v10-only skips (no regression vs the
original 79/79); static scan PASS.** v9 multi-process race: SQLite 10/10
`[201,409]` vs PostgreSQL **10/10 `[201,500]`/`[500,201]`** — the T10
exactly-one-decision invariant does NOT hold under READ COMMITTED.
Findings F1–F5 (details:
[SUMMARY-PG.md](https://github.com/stokonn/Goldberg/blob/e37ed00b9205ce22e9e8ec494651e900708ee1e3/spikes/contract-c6/results/SUMMARY-PG.md)):
F1 lost-update/double-approve under READ COMMITTED with both fixes
(`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`; SERIALIZABLE + explicit 40001→409 mapping)
demonstrated as probes only; F2 rollback parity + **no FK constraints in the
C6 DDL** (task 6.1 gap); F3 idempotency parity + concurrent duplicate key →
23505 must serve replay; F4 audit chain parity + audit-seq race (seq must be
serialized); F5 SQLite→PG differences (`BEGIN IMMEDIATE` absent, 42702 column
qualification fixed portably, `rowid`, `?`, **int8→string driver default**).
**Local PostgreSQL ≠ Supabase: the Supabase-hosted proof stays BLOCKED
(D5b/Q1 + C4 + ORD-A steps 4–6). F1–F5 are design inputs for task 6.1, not
authorization. 6.0f UNCHECKED; 6.0d/6.0e NOT AUTHORIZED; 6.1–6.18
unchecked; Q1/D5b UNRESOLVED (Q1-D owner preference unchanged, preference
only); C4 OPEN; C2 §12 OPEN; ORD-A sequencing-only; Stage 7 untouched;
Stage 5 remains COMPLETE; 0 CZK/month.**

**C4 preliminary verification + documentation reconciliation (2026-10-22,
documentation-only; C4 stays OPEN):** the official Cloudflare/Supabase pricing,
terms, DPA, region and backup sources were re-fetched (public documents only —
no console login, no billing/API call, no resource, no payment method touched)
and reconciled with the 2026-10-21 snapshot; results recorded as **§F** of
`stage-6/C4-PREPROVISIONING-CHECKLIST.md` (§A–§C statuses untouched).
**Recorded: both provider accounts now exist** (owner-side; Cloudflare
corroborated by read-only MCP checkpoint #1 comment `6343122203`; Supabase
from the owner's statement only, never agent-verified); **Cloudflare MCP
read-only auth verified; Workers Free remains available; Supabase Free remains
available with stated limits; `eu-central-1` remains a documented specific
region; automatic backups NOT included on Supabase Free** (official free-tier
`db dump` self-export guidance confirmed); **Supabase Free quotas can result
in service restrictions** (pause / read-only / 402 after grace period);
**billing and payment-method status NOT verified; subprocessor and transfer
reviews still incomplete.** Doc-date diff: all 2026-10-21 stamps unchanged
except CF Website Terms date + Supabase terms version badge (not re-renderable
— honest gaps, remain ⚠ day-of); **CF observability announcement (2026-12-01)
unchanged**; its target page (upd. 2026-10-15, new source) shows **Free =
0.5 GB/day ingestion + 7-day retention, no paid overage on Free** —
preliminary 0-CZK read, re-verify day-of and for any access ≥ 2026-12-01.
**Q1-D = owner's preferred structure subject to eligibility verification
(preference only).** **Gates unchanged: C4 OPEN (§D steps 1–9 unchecked);
6.0f UNCHECKED; 6.1–6.18 unchecked; Q1/D5b UNRESOLVED and blocking; C2 §12
OPEN; 6.0d/6.0e NOT AUTHORIZED; ORD-A sequencing-only; 0 CZK/month; no
provisioning/account/billing/OAuth/deployment change; Stage 7 untouched;
Stage 5 remains COMPLETE.**

**C6-PG concurrency hardening (2026-10-22, experimental spike comparison —
never merged):** both candidate F1/F3/F4 fixes were implemented in the
isolated spike branch `spike/goldberg-0.11-stage-6-contract-pg` (commits
`d8e82d5` code + `c21e550` evidence; faithful sources and the original
`results/pg/` deviation evidence byte-untouched) and compared on local
PostgreSQL 17.11 (`read committed`): **`for-update`** (submission-row lock +
`audit_head` append mutex) vs **`serializable`** (SSI + bounded retry +
explicit 40001/40P01/23505 handling, exhaustion → 409 never 500), both with
the shared F3 store hardening (concurrent idempotency 23505 → serve stored
replay; 422 on mismatch). **Executed:** v11 7/7 (37 tests); the repeated
20-trial multi-process race restored `[201,409]` in **20/20 trials per
strategy** (vs the faithful server's 10/10 deviations in v9); **for-update
needed 0 SQLSTATE retries everywhere** (incl. a 20-decision F4 scale run with
consecutive audit seqs and a coherent chain); **serializable needed 21×
`40001`** in the race and **218× at 20-way concurrency** (maxAttempts=64),
0 exhausted; deterministic F3 store race verified. Full executor: SQLite
regression 93 tests / 79 pass / **0 fail** / 14 honest PG-only skips;
PostgreSQL venue **123/123 pass, 0 fail**; static scan PASS (23 files);
container removed after capture. **Conclusion (design input for 6.1):
`SELECT … FOR UPDATE` is the recommended pattern** (deterministic, zero
retries); serializable works but needs a generous bounded retry and
40001→409 mapping; concurrent same-key decision duplicates answer `[201,409]`
while sequential duplicates replay. Evidence at `c21e550`
(`results/pg-hardening/SUMMARY-HARDENING.md`). **Gates unchanged: 6.0f
UNCHECKED; 6.1–6.18 unchecked; Q1/D5b UNRESOLVED; C4 OPEN; C2 §12 OPEN;
6.0d/6.0e NOT AUTHORIZED; ORD-A sequencing-only; 0 CZK/month; not a Supabase
run; no merge/tag/release; Stage 7 untouched.**

**C4 owner-side console observations (2026-10-22, attributed owner facts,
never agent-verified — recorded as §F.5 / N-11–N-13 of
`stage-6/C4-PREPROVISIONING-CHECKLIST.md`):** **Cloudflare Workers Free is
active with no payment method attached** (billing non-verification unchanged —
MCP has no billing scope); a **Supabase "Personal Free" organization exists
with zero projects** (no project created; 2-project Free cap not consumed; an
organization existing is not billing evidence); **Frankfurt (`eu-central-1`)
is selectable in the Supabase project-creation form** (informs SB-P7/§D step 6
but does not close it). **No screenshots, console exports or account
identifiers are stored in GitHub.** Supabase billing/payment status remains
unverified; project creation remains unperformed and unauthorized. **Gates
unchanged: C4 OPEN (§D steps 1–9 unchecked); 6.0f UNCHECKED; 6.1–6.18
unchecked; Q1/D5b UNRESOLVED and blocking; C2 §12 OPEN; 6.0d/6.0e NOT
AUTHORIZED; ORD-A sequencing-only; 0 CZK/month; no agent console login, no
billing/API call, no resource created or modified; Stage 7 untouched; Stage 5
remains COMPLETE.**
