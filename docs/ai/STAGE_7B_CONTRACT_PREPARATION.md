# Stage 7B API contract integration preparation — authorized scope

Owner instruction: “Goldberg 0.11 — Stage 7B: API Contract Integration Preparation”
(2026-10-23). Recover current PMP context without restoring/overwriting files;
audit the latest verified committed Stage 6 candidate through immutable Git
objects; prepare synthetic versioned shared fixtures; implement only supported
Android safety improvements and regression tests; run host verification.

Preserve the existing dirty Stage 7B continuation. No Stage 6 worktree changes,
production networking/moderation, mapping activation without explicit contract
approval, physical phone, AVD wipe, deployment, merge or release.

- [x] Inspect policy, latest handoffs, acceptance, checkpoint and dirty worktree.
- [x] Pin committed Stage 6 sources and audit normative/candidate/Android differences.
- [x] Add versioned synthetic fixtures with provenance, success/error/conflict/replay
  cases; clearly separate normative, candidate and unapproved proposal semantics.
- [x] Harden Android production transport boundary and supported numeric/parsing
  safety only; keep disputed mapping inactive.
- [x] Run JVM/build/androidTest compilation/lint/host scripts/whitespace checks.
- [x] Bounded read-only emulator availability/stability investigation; preserve blockers.
- [x] PMP milestone checkpoints, local docs and existing Issue #31 synchronized (final readback required below).

Starting state: branch `feature/goldberg-0.11-stage-7b`, HEAD `cee9330` plus
uncommitted continuation; PMP checkpoint `d4d4ef74-7a0f-4282-86eb-7a85e455a6d0`.
Prior 251 JVM tests passed; runtime/emulator/integration acceptance BLOCKED;
Stage 7A X10 OPEN; Stage 8 pending. Earlier PMP metadata-only scope is historical;
this instruction authorizes the limited Android-only work above, not live activation.


## Stage 7B contract preparation — recovered verified checkpoint (2026-10-23)

**Current status: local preparation verified; Stage 7B acceptance remains IN PROGRESS / BLOCKED.**
Branch `feature/goldberg-0.11-stage-7b`, HEAD `cee9330f82cf2e57dcdc66a63d94b7a4e3749888`
plus preserved uncommitted continuation. No application code was changed by this
recovery session. Stage 6 trees untouched; no commit/push, merge, release or deploy.
`.pmp/` and `.pmp.yml` remain private/untracked. This entry supersedes older current-status
summaries below; historical checkpoints and earlier counts remain audit history.

**Purpose/scope:** finish the interrupted API contract integration preparation by
recovering source/evidence, retaining supported Android safety changes, and making
contract decisions explicit without inventing or activating a backend mapping.

- [x] Read policy, PMP sequence-3 audit checkpoint, AI handoffs, Stage 7B checklist /
  acceptance, latest Issue #31 comments, branch/status/diffs and existing evidence.
- [x] Recover immutable `bcc7796` audit and `faf9ba3` comparison; 29 synthetic cases
  and 15 pinned hashes. Normative design, legacy C6, local candidate and inactive
  mapping proposal stay separate. No Stage 6 backend tests executed here.
- [x] Retain already implemented application-disabled transport even with a saved
  endpoint/token; independent decision disable; strict capability principal/string
  validation, exact legacy Int revisions and Long audit sequences, cursor type
  rejection, typed malformed-payload errors. No candidate dialect adapter enabled.
- [x] Preserve recovered successful Gradle outputs: 36 suites / **275 JVM tests,
  0 failures/errors/skips**, including **24 AdminContractIntegrationTest cases**.
  `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug assembleDebugAndroidTest lintDebug
  --no-daemon --max-workers=1` completed in 2m26s; retained follow-up 13s pass.
  These are **prior-session executions inspected now**, not new JVM executions.
  Initial two capability-test failures remain preserved and are superseded by
  the passing reports after their pre-interruption fix.
- [x] Lint recovered: **0 errors/fatal, 132 warnings, 1 hint**. Instrumentation APK
  compiled/assembled only; **0 instrumentation bodies executed**.
- [x] Recovery session executed all six host scripts: contract fixtures/provenance,
  agent policy, backup formats 1–3, history paging, localization (1050 EN/CZ), and
  migrations v1–9→10 DDL; all PASS. `git diff --check` PASS.
- [x] Recovery session verified APK signing, badging, ZIP integrity and exclusion of
  test corpus. APK `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`, 24,140,673 bytes,
  SHA-256 `6976d76e9bd936cd5b45e26f1910f86c3105863a8fe2bbf6f1269aaafc7e269b`;
  `com.opus.piano`, development version **0.10.1/code 11**; trusted signer
  `53eface4978f03dd7f0d7f1eb97ab94eed97055fe04a2a0fab9a7f280141d59e`.
  No application source file newer than APK; test-only corpus files are newer.
  Source manifest reconstructed on recovery, not contemporaneous build/CI proof.
- [x] Recover bounded emulator investigation: read-only `stage5-api36`, explicit
  intended serial `emulator-5582`, no snapshot/wipe; **SIGSEGV / exit -11 after
  21.68s**. This is host setup failure, not application evidence. No new launch,
  ADB operation or physical device use in recovery; no screenshots inspected.
- [ ] Stage 6/owner contract approval and actual Android/backend integration.
- [ ] Functioning permitted emulator; rendered/no-scroll screenshots, accessibility,
  WorkManager/notification runtime, seeded upgrade and owner acceptance.

**Unresolved G1–G6:** G1 server stats; G2 server queue search/display labels;
G3 audit server filtering/search; G4 verified current catalogue before-values;
G5 live credential/session/principal lifecycle; G6 explicit open + two revision
expectations and result/conflict/replay HTTP semantics. All remain OPEN. Existing
bounded exact-or-unavailable/client-side fallbacks do not close server gaps.
Additional G7 public DTO/cursor/HTTP binding, G8 numeric representation, G9 audit
vocabulary/time windows and G11 validation/reason/license policy remain OPEN.
**G10 local Android production networking boundary is closed**; this is no backend
approval. Production networking and moderation decisions remain DISABLED. X10 OPEN.
Personal database/schema/backup/practice data unchanged.

**Next milestone:** obtain explicit approval of versioned shared public
session/capability/queue/detail/open/dual-revision/audit/error/validation fixtures;
then implement one approved adapter and run isolated integration tests. Obtain a
working allowed emulator venue before executing the remaining acceptance matrix.
Do not select a dialect heuristically, default missing expectations, revive
networking from an endpoint setting or retry the known crashing emulator unchanged.

Evidence: `docs/planning/goldberg-0.11/stage-7/stage-7b/results/contract-preparation-2026-10-23/`
(recovered raw logs/XML, failure history, emulator diagnostics, source hashes,
artifact identity and recovery host checks). [Recovery Issue checkpoint](https://github.com/stokonn/Goldberg/issues/31#issuecomment-6368949572). Final PMP checkpoint is read through
`pmp resume` / `pmp history`; native PMP test-count evidence is not fabricated from
recovered JUnit outputs. Issue #31 remains OPEN; Project remains In Progress.
